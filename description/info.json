Instead of relying on a burn wallet, tokens are completely removed from circulation when USE is burned.\r\n\r\nUSE has a static 3% token tax that is imposed on all buys, sells, and transfers on the Harmony (ONE) network. Of this tax, 1/3 is used for token marketing, 1/3 is used for on-chain rewards, and 1/3 is sent to the decentralized Furnace protocol. Based on the health of the liquidity, the Furnace will either pair liquidity, buyback, and/or burn \u2014 making USE the first token with a decentralized, auto-stabilizing protocol to manage its liquidity pool.\r\n\r\nUSE tokens bridged to other networks have the symbol 1USE and do not incur taxation (0% tax).\r\n\r\nWho Are the Founders of Useless (USE)?\r\n\r\nUSE originally started as a meme token, but was salvaged by the community and relaunched to provide utility for a decentralized ranking platform. David Wyly was elected community leader, and founded Useless Crypto, LLC to help govern the global community-led project and manage multi-signature cryptoassets.\r\n\r\nOver time, the project team grew to a global network of more than 60 volunteer staff and moderators.\r\n\r\nThe six directors of Useless Crypto, LLC are multi-signature safe keyholders, where 4/6 signatures are required to facilitate a transaction. Notably:\r\n\r\n- David Wyly, 15 years in Software Engineering and Engineering Management.\r\n- Lance Badger, 15 years in DevOps Engineering and Systems Architecture.\r\n- Amir Arafat, 12 years in UI Engineering and Mobile App Architecture.\r\n- Jackie Dutton, 6 years in Content Creation and Television.\r\n- Joseph Andrews, 7 years in Software Engineering and Product Management.\r\n- Stefan Alexandrov, 5 years in Macroeconomic Research and Finance.\r\n\r\nWhere Can I Buy Useless (USE)?\r\n\r\nYou can purchase USE easily on the AllForOne App by Useless Crypto.\r\n\r\nUSE is available for trading on a growing number of decentralized exchanges, with Binance Smart Chain (BSC) pairings on PancakeSwap and Harmony (ONE) pairings on Hermes and FoxSwap.\r\n\r\nThe token is also available on BitMart.\"",

The business value of AI is becoming clearer each day; however, there\u2019s a significant gap between the people developing AI tools (researchers and academics) and the businesses that want to use them. Most organizations need a more customized solution than what a single AI project can offer, and research projects oftentimes have trouble accessing a large enough data set to build effective machine learning. SingularityNET closes these gaps.\r\n\r\nThe long-term vision of the SingulairtyNET team is to build a network of complex AI Agent interactions primarily using resources from the OpenCog Foundation. To look at this further, let\u2019s check out their in-house built humanoid robot, Sophia. Sophia uses a combination of AI Agents that range from natural language processing to physical motor controls to operate. You tell Sophia to summarize a video that\u2019s embedded in a webpage. To do this, Sophia sends a request to Agent A. Through its AI, Agent A knows that Agent B specializes in analyzing and transcribing video while Agent C specializes in summarizing text. Agent A pays Agent B and Agent C to perform these tasks while Sophia pays Agent A to coordinate. All the while, each Agent has updated their own AI with the network information gained from these tasks and combines it with their previous experiences and knowledge. Therefore, the collective AI of the system grows at a faster rate than any individual Agent.\r\n\r\nSingularityNET wants to build a decentralized protocol for creators and users of AI to interact with each other, to not only help individual projects benefit by leveraging the strengths of other AI systems that might handle certain tasks better, but ultimately to develop SingularityNET into a functioning AI system itself, with nodes on the network making their own decisions about how to connect services and proactively provide solutions to academic and business problems. Tokenizing the network creates an AI marketplace where AI developers and sellers can not only link with others who might assist in building more robust AI solutions, but also allow AI services and products to be bought and sold, creating revenue and establishing price points where none have existed before.\r\n\r\nThe SingularityNET team boasts 50+ AI developers and 10+ PhDs. Dr. Ben Goertzel leads the group as CEO and Chief Scientist. He\u2019s also the Chairman of the OpenCog Foundation and the Artificial General Intelligence Society, as well as the Chief Scientist at Hanson Robotics, the partner company helping bring SingularityNET to life. Dr. David Hanson, founder of Hanson Robotics, serves as the Robotics Lead. Most famously, Hanson Robotics built Sophia, the most expressive humanoid robot to date.

The Aragon project is open source and led by the Aragon Foundation. It also includes a token, ANT, that grants voting rights to make decisions about the direction of future development. Eventually, Aragon hopes to be a fully decentralized autonomous organization and dApp that\u2019s a neutral jurisdiction for anyone to create an organization on the blockchain. \r\n\r\nIn the early days of development, the project is relying on the nonprofit Aragon Foundation to provide direction and support as the project gets off the ground. The idea, however, is to eventually dissolve, scale back, or change the nature of the Foundation as community support grows. In the future, Aragon will be entirely decentralized and community led. Holders of the ANT token will have voting rights on all issues concerning Aragon. Aragon is an open source, non-profit project. It has many contributors. It also doesn\u2019t technically have a CEO or CTO. Instead, it has a project lead. But don\u2019t get it twisted, the lead is essentially the CEO. uis Cuende is leading the project. In 2011, he received a \u201cBest Underage European Programmer\u201d award, and he\u2019s a recipient of Forbes\u2019 30 under 30 recognition. He\u2019s a young guy, but with leadership and technical chops. He has advised the Vice President of the European Commission and is an MIT Innovators Under 35 awardee. He has founded several startups and created the first Linux distribution with face login.\r\n\r\nAragon offers several core features. It has a module for identity management and closely related modules for ownership and access control. Other modules include shareholder voting, fundraising through token generation, HR onboarding and payroll, and accounts payable/receivable. Taken together, the core functionality of Aragon covers the critical aspects of accounting, governance, and identity that make modern companies work. As you can see, these modules make up most of the administrative functions that a modern company or organization requires. It\u2019s important to emphasize that these modules can individually be turned on and off, providing instant customization for the company\u2019s needs. In addition, all of the code behind Aragon is open source. A company\u2019s development team could edit them as needed to fulfill the company\u2019s requirements. \r\n\r\nThe modular design of Aragon doesn\u2019t stop with the core modules that come standard. Just as companies can edit existing modules, they\u2019re free to develop completely new models as well. They can also develop atop the data and structures of existing models for extended functionality. The modular nature of Aragon, combined with its open source ethos, means we could see a whole ecosystem of free to use modules that extend capacity for organizations on Aragon. Aragon explicitly has the goal of creating a digital jurisdiction. Just like countries have jurisdiction over their citizens when it comes to courts of law, Aragon wants to create the first digital court of law. This court wouldn\u2019t operate based on country boundaries. Instead, it would help enforce digital contracts between organizations on the Aragon platform.\r\n\r\nThe ANT token is the native token of Aragon and plays a critical role in the governance model and incentive structure of the platform. It represents the wealth of the decentralized economy and was initially sold during Aragon\u2019s highly successful ICO in May 2017 that raised $24 million. Subsequently, the ANT token has come to represent a powerful share of the governance on the platform. ANT holders can vote on proposals, participate in arbitration and the decentralized court system, and help contribute to the non-profit Aragon Foundation or to research and development through the Aragon Nest program.",

AUR was launched on the 25th of January, 2014, by an anonymous developer who went by the pseudonym of Baldur Friggjar \u00d3\u00f0insson. It was originally based on Litecoin, using the Scrypt algorithm with a Proof of Work mechanism, but was later updated to use a multi-algorithm architecture in 2016, forked from DigiByte.\r\n\r\nAuroracoin uses the PoW consensus mechanism, which utilises device hashing power to solve a complex mathematical problem in order to authenticate a transaction proposed to be stored in the blockchain. The difficulty of solving the problem ensures that authenticating forged transactions is very difficult unless the attacker owns an impractically large chunk of the network\u2019s total hashing power. AUR is one of the only cryptocurrencies to use a combination of five different hashing algorithms, namely Gr\u00f8stl, Qubit, scrypt, SHA-256, and Skein.\r\n\r\nWhile initially very popular, Auroracoin has seen little to no activity for a while, with poor marketing, and frequent dev team changes. Reasons for little growth have been various, from slow adoption in Iceland, to developers leaving and joining the project midway. However, it is expected to not go lower than the recent low, and might see a rise as AUR plans to launch a more aggressive marketing campaign in Iceland to promote the coin among the masses. Unlike most other altcoins, Auroracoin has made extensive changes to the original codebase. It has introduced security measures such as Automatic checkpointing, and protecting against known flaws present in the BTC blockchain, such as 51% block replacement attacks.",

The AppCoins project was designed to foster innovation in technology. To create a universal digital advertising protocol for mobile devices, the developers at Aptoide designed AppCoins. AppCoins is an application-specific token which was designed to create a universal digital advertising protocol for mobile devices. It can be used to incentivize behavior which can then be used to raise money for the development of an app. Aptoide is the 3rd biggest app store with a with over 4 billion downloads and 1 million Apps. WIth over 230,000,000 users, apps and support in 40 languages, more than 2.8 billion downloads, the cryptocoin can revolutionize how people use mobile technology and applications. \r\n\r\nAppCoins will bring in a range of standard protocols to be followed by all developers to advertise their games or apps in the app store.The \u201cAppCoin\u201d ERC20 token will bridge the gap between the advertisers and the users. A user earns 85% from every advertising investment that goes inside the app store. The user has to then use those coins to buy items (in-app purchases) inside the apps and games, thus, generating the return of the investment to the developers.\r\nMost industry enthusiasts believe that the immediate forecast of AppCoins price trends leans towards the downward slope. It is expected to be priced at an average price of ~$0.191 for a long while, with a few minor fluctuations.The trend is however, expected to stabilize at this point until Aptoide as a platform gains traction within the mobile usage industry.\r\n\r\nOnce the ROI of the Aptoide platform starts multiplying significantly due to an increase in the number of users and developers on the network, the price will increase significantly and will correspond to good returns for investors.\r\n\r\nAppCoins is an innovative concept with a tidy site that conveys the underlying ideas well. As described above, investment in APPC is a favorable option for both developers and users. However, it is evident that the returns of the AppCoins\u2019 solution are directly proportional to the development of the relationship of the App-store and the OEMs in the ecosystem. Thus, the amount of profit or returns gained by a trader will be a function of the ROI which the platform develops and its reputation in the crypto space.With almost 50% of the APPC coins in circulation as of July 2018, users have a good opportunity to buy them. However, it should be noted that it does not form a good investment option for a short period of time.",

Maintained by a group of aviation professionals, Aeron wants to reduce air transport-related accidents, which it says currently numbers around 3302 per year. One of the major causes of such accidents is the lack of real experience among pilots, since unsecured flight log data from them is susceptible to fraud and forgery. Also, due to \"pay to fly\" experiences, corrupt flight schools, negligence of aircraft operators, the primary data driving any decision is affected.\r\n\r\nAeron is built upon a robust and cryptographically secure database that makes it unique compared to other online travel companies, travel search services or internal applications made for flight officials. With this technology, falsification of data can be kept at a minimum. Additionally, as you would expect from a blockchain-backed application, key information is safely stored and is accessible to everyone with 100% transparency. Except that it now comes secured by a multi-sig authentication system that prevents any type of security breach. According to Aeron's Whitepaper, \"The pilot\u2019s application is used by a pilot for personal flight logging. The company application collects and verifies data from aircraft operators, maintenance organizations, flight schools and fixed base operators\".\r\n\r\nAeron (ARN) is an ERC20 compliant Ethereum based token, with a fixed supply of 20,000,000 ARN. When the token was launched, a fixed amount of tokens were created and after which no more tokens are to be minted. About 60% of the supply is estimated to be in circulation. The supply should decrease over time when ARN tokens as taken out of circulation. Once Aeron receives ARN tokens in exchange of services, the coins will be again released in to the network.\r\n\r\nAccording to its whitepaper, Aeron plans to have a user base of 300000 by the end of 2020. This would encourage it to embed new features on its platform.\r\nWith the help of multi-app functionality and block technology, the company envisions to have an \u201cairline in the pocket\u201d of sorts within two years.

Some zones act as hubs with respect to other zones, allowing many zones to interoperate through a shared hub. The architecture is a more general application of the Bitcoin sidechains concept, using classic BFT and Proof-of-Stake algorithms, instead of Proof-of-Work.Cosmos can interoperate with multiple other applications and cryptocurrencies, something other blockchains can\u2019t do well. By creating a new zone, you can plug any blockchain system into the Cosmos hub and pass tokens back and forth between those zones, without the need for an intermediary.\r\n\r\nWhile the Cosmos Hub is a multi-asset distributed ledger, there is a special native token called the atom. Atoms have three use cases: as a spam-prevention mechanism, as staking tokens, and as a voting mechanism in governance.\r\n\r\nAs a spam prevention mechanism, Atoms are used to pay fees. The fee may be proportional to the amount of computation required by the transaction, similar to Ethereum\u2019s concept of \u201cgas\u201d. Fee distribution is done in-protocol and a protocol specification is described here.\r\n\r\nAs staking tokens, Atoms can be \u201cbonded\u201d in order to earn block rewards.

Some zones act as hubs with respect to other zones, allowing many zones to interoperate through a shared hub. The architecture is a more general application of the Bitcoin sidechains concept, using classic BFT and Proof-of-Stake algorithms, instead of Proof-of-Work.Cosmos can interoperate with multiple other applications and cryptocurrencies, something other blockchains can\u2019t do well. By creating a new zone, you can plug any blockchain system into the Cosmos hub and pass tokens back and forth between those zones, without the need for an intermediary.\r\n\r\nWhile the Cosmos Hub is a multi-asset distributed ledger, there is a special native token called the atom. Atoms have three use cases: as a spam-prevention mechanism, as staking tokens, and as a voting mechanism in governance.\r\n\r\nAs a spam prevention mechanism, Atoms are used to pay fees. The fee may be proportional to the amount of computation required by the transaction, similar to Ethereum\u2019s concept of \u201cgas\u201d. Fee distribution is done in-protocol and a protocol specification is described here.\r\n\r\nAs staking tokens, Atoms can be \u201cbonded\u201d in order to earn block rewards. The economic security of the Cosmos Hub is a function of the amount of Atoms staked. The more Atoms that are collateralized, the more \u201cskin\u201d there is at stake and the higher the cost of attacking the network.

A strict limit of 100 000 000 AWC will be created, never to be increased.

Listing new assets in Atomic Wallet - Each cryptocurrency, foundation or token will be able to purchase integration within the Atomic Wallet for the AWC-tokens. The price of integration will be 100,000 AWC-tokens. It will be a great possibility for the new coins and tokens to become a part of Atomic Wallet ecosystem\r\n\r\n2.Listing new assets in Atomic swap exchange - Each cryptocurrency, foundation or token will be able to purchase integration within the Atomic Wallet swap exchange market for the AWC-tokens.

The main upgrade is the increase in the block size limit from 1MB to 8MB. This effectively allows miners on the BCH chain to process up to 8 times more payments per second in comparison to Bitcoin. This makes for faster, cheaper transactions and a much smoother user experience.\r\n\r\nWhy was Bitcoin Cash Created?\r\n\r\nThe main objective of Bitcoin Cash is to to bring back the essential qualities of money inherent in the original Bitcoin software. Over the years, these qualities were filtered out of Bitcoin Core and progress was stifled by various people, organizations, and companies involved in Bitcoin protocol development. The result is that Bitcoin Core is currently unusable as money due to increasingly high fees per transactions and transfer times taking hours to complete. This is all because of the 1MB limitation of Bitcoin Core\u2019s block size, causing it unable to accommodate to large number of transactions.\r\n\r\nEssentially Bitcoin Cash is a community-activated upgrade (otherwise known as a hard fork) of Bitcoin that increased the block size to 8MB, solving the scaling issues that plague Bitcoin Core today.\r\n\r\nNov 16th 2018: A hashwar resulted in a split between Bitcoin SV and Bitcoin ABC",

Our blockchain platform\u2019s mission is to enable innovations from not only new projects with breakthrough ideas in this space but also support any companies who see blockchain as a solution to achieve intensive margin from current operations. Additionally, we aim to bring that support to all verticals including supply chain, media and entertainment, identity and credentials, healthcare, trade finance, financial services, government, digital assets, retail, and much more. Finally, the BHO network does not only include its own application but also all other applications developed on the BHO chain.\r\n\r\nWhat are Our Vision, Mission, and Core Values? \r\nVision: BHO Network aims to become a global open blockchain ecosystem, beginning with the Southeast Asian market. BHO Network will be a flexible platform, to provide solutions for simple and practical blockchain applications. \r\nMission: With a talented and enthusiastic young team, we provide user-friendly, safe, and risk-reduced blockchain products, making BHO Network an ecosystem rooted in real life. \r\nCore Values: C - Credibility: Our most important core value is credibility. We build our organization based on trust and deliver it to our customers through genuineness and transparency. A - Accessibility: BHO Network is made accessible to everyone to explore our products and ecosystem through ease of use and understanding. R - Result: We stay committed to our vision and mission to deliver the highest values to our investors & users. E - Empower: We empower our users and put the decision-making rights in our communities, staying true to the definition of decentralization.\r\n\r\nWho Are The Founders of BHO Network?\r\n\r\nCo-founder & CEO - Nhat Phan (Mr.). He is also the co-founder of VNbot - Capital Management System. Mr. Nhat Nhat himself has a solid background in CryptoCurrency, Social Media, Game Online MMORPG.\r\nCo-founder & CTO - Duong Le (Mr.). He is a Senior AI engineer, also the Co-founder of Guu and Polaris.\r\nWhat Does BHO Network Offer? With uniqueness in unparalleled transaction throughput and immunity to disruptions, yet at minimal costs, BHO Chain facilitates intelligent feature creation explicitly for the fulfillment of financial services by exploiting unique features of the blockchain. Moreover, we would like to introduce BHO, our native utility token, that is used for: * Transaction fees in BHO Chain and lending fees; * Rewarding for validator nodes on the network via staking BHO tokens, and in parachain crowd loan; * Exercising on-chain governance rights; * Participating in BHO Launchpad.\r\n\r\nWhat Makes BHO Network Unique? \r\nUtilizing the Substrate framework, BHO Network is dedicated to promote scalability through parachain and transaction\u2019s efficiency, in response to the slow transaction times of other blockchains. Furthermore, the interoperability design and compatibility between chains allow different blockchains and applications to share information and functions. BHO Network blockchain is able to empower the NFT world whereas GameFi & Metaverse projects may utilize tokenization to convert their assets into NFTs and asset-based tokens as proof of creditworthiness for unlimited access to diverse financial services in the crypto space. The new-gen blockchain intends to extend support full tool kits for game developer to build and approach player throughout Multi-chain NFT marketplace, Interoperable DEX and Wallet; True to our roadmap, BHO Network has launched significant initiatives intended to popularize DeFi adoption. Our Staking Rewards Event attracted 140 million BHO value locked, which is equal to approximately 70% of its net circulating supply within the first 10 days of the event. Later, one of BHO Network\u2019 key features - NFTs issuance - was fully developed on its Testnet platform, with the very first one being the project\u2019s official logo. BHO Network has also launched the Testnet-version blockchain called Cygnus with key features of creation, destruction, and listing of users-own tokens and NFTs; adding or creating a wallet to send and receive BHO token and other related features. Under these circumstances, BHO Network\u2019s Mainnet was set to launch by December, 2021. Recently, on March 31, BHO have successfully launched our Launchpad product named BHO Pad. It is a decentralized start-up launch platform based on the latest blockchain technologies with an extremely user-friendly interface. In addition, BHO Pad provides a \u201ctriple threat\u201d solution to help solve specific difficulties for blockchain start-ups. BHO Pad not only supports capital raising for start-ups but also provides operational resources and consultations in strategic planning for projects\r\n\r\nHow Do We \u201cOver-Deliver\u201d To Our Clients? \r\nHigh speed The transaction processing speed allows BHO network to handle thousands of transactions per second, making it compatible with thousands of validators without sacrificing performance. Low cost With higher block time and block size, the BHO network offers an incredibly low transaction fee. BHO uses a weight-based fee model as opposed to a gas-metering model. As such, fees are charged prior to transaction execution; once the fee is paid, nodes will execute the transaction. Eco-friendly BHO\u2019s network novel consensus mechanism is flexible, efficient, and green making it sustainable and the platform of choice for many developers and innovators for the long-term. Scaling The nature of BHO Network Consensus can either be layered on top of existing networks creating pre-network finality or it can be layered on top of custom virtual machines creating independent networks that can be tailored for specific purposes. BHO network is fundamentally a new approach to achieving consensus with the aim of creating a flexible, scalable and usable blockchain system.",

Each yield optimization method on Beefy Finance has its own unique strategy for farming, which normally involves the reinvestment of crypto assets staked in liquidity pools.

They make use of automation to continually invest and reinvest deposited funds, which help to achieve high levels of compounded interest. Vaults are the core of the Beefy Finance ecosystem. In a Beefy vault, you earn more of the asset you stake, regardless of whether it\u2019s a liquidity pool (LP) token or a single asset.\r\n\r\nDespite what the name 'vault' suggests, user funds are never locked on Beefy.Finance.

Certik has already provided audits for such projects as Ocean Protocol, NEO, Ontology, and Waves.\r\n\r\nThe supply of $BIFI is limited at 80,000 tokens and available on the top decentralized exchanges such as Binance, 1inchexchange and PancakeSwap. \r\n\r\nWhat is $BIFI?\r\n\r\n$BIFI is the native governance token of Beefy Finance. $BIFI Tokens can be staked on the Beefy platform to gain rewards and interest. A portion of the fees paid by anyone using Beefy\u2019s yield optimization vaults are distributed to holders of $BIFI staked on the platform. Token holders also have a right to create and vote on proposals to the platform as part of its governance system. They can vote without un-staking their tokens. \r\n\r\nWhat makes Beefy Finance unique?\r\n\r\nThere are lots of farms to choose from across several blockchains. Beefy automates and optimizes different investment strategies, allowing token holders to benefit from the upside of complex farming protocols. Users can request new vaults directly from Beefy\u2019s developers and the time it takes to answer these requests is very low.\r\n\r\nWhat are yield farming and yield optimization?\r\n\r\nYield farming is simply a way to make some interest with crypto holdings. A yield optimizer is an automated service that seeks to gain the maximum possible return on crypto-investments made through DeFi platforms. They work much more efficiently than attempting to maximize yield through manual means. Each yield optimization method on Beefy Finance has its own unique strategy for farming, which normally involves the reinvestment of crypto assets staked in liquidity pools. At the most simple level, it farms the rewards given from staked assets and reinvests them back into the liquidity pool for the user.\r\n\r\nWhat are Beefy vaults?\r\n\r\nVaults are investment instruments that employ an optimized set of strategies for yield farming. They make use of automation to continually invest and reinvest deposited funds, which help to achieve high levels of compounded interest. Vaults are the core of the Beefy Finance ecosystem. In a Beefy vault, you earn more of the asset you stake, regardless of whether it\u2019s a liquidity pool (LP) token or a single asset.\r\n\r\nDespite what the name 'vault' suggests, user funds are never locked on Beefy.Finance. Users can withdraw from a vault at any moment in time and Beefy does not own the funds staked in its vaults.\r\n\r\nWhat fees are incurred from using Beefy Finance?\r\n\r\nThe performance fees are already built into the displayed APY of each vault and daily rate. Most vaults available on Beefy Finance take 4.5% of harvest rewards. \r\nThe performance fee on users vault profits is largely distributed back to $BIFI stakers and is the main source of Beefy Finance's platform revenue: 3% is distributed back to $BIFI stakers, 0.5% is allocated to treasury, 0.5% to the strategist that developed the vault and 0.5% for the one calling the harvest function. \r\n\r\nEach vault has either a deposit or withdrawal fee of 0.1% or less, which is there to protect bad actors from abusing the vaults. This is shared with all other stakers in that specific vault. Users should also consider network transaction fees when adding or removing funds. These fees do not go to Beefy, but to the operators keeping the blockchain network up and running.\r\n",

These include trading fees, transaction fees, listing fees and others.

Launched in 2017, Bancor was the first DeFi protocol.\r\nToday, it generates millions in fees per month for depositors, offering up to 60% APR on tokens like ETH, WBTC, LINK, MATIC, AAVE & more. Bancor is owned by its community as a decentralized autonomous organization (Bancor DAO).\r\nThe protocol token used on the network is the \u201cBancor Network Token,\u201d BNT. The protocol\u2019s token allows traders to provide liquidity for the pools available on the network. Anyone can contribute liquidity to the pools. When liquidity providers contribute liquidity to a pool, they are eligible to receive fees for trades that pass through the pool. Liquidity providers will receive pool tokens that represent their share of liquidity, fees, and Liquidity Mining rewards in the pool.\r\n\r\nHow Many Bancor (BNT) Coins Are In Circulation?\r\n\r\nThe Bancor Network Token (BNT) has an elastic supply, afforded by the protocol's minting and burning of tokens to maintain trading liquidity levels in Bancor pools. Protocol-owned trading liquidity earns swap fees from trading volume, such that the protocol comes to hold more BNT over time. The protocol's new balance of BNT is then burned in exchange for pool tokens when LPs stake the equivalent amount of their own BNT. Due to swap fees earned, more BNT is ultimately burned than was initially supplied by the protocol. This excess of BNT is then burned to offset the cost of impermanent loss, deflating the overall supply of BNT in the long term.\r\n\r\nHow Is The Bancor Network Secured?\r\n\r\nBancor is one of the longest-running and most heavily audited projects in crypto, receiving stellar ratings from leading auditors including Certik, PeckShield, and Halborn. In addition, Bancor received one of the highest safety scores to date by DeFiSafety (96%) in 2021.\r\n\r\nOur most recent articles about Bancor:\r\n\r\nImpermanent Loss: What Is It and How Can I Reduce Its Impact?\r\nCrypto Outperforms Traditional Markets With DEX Tokens Leading the Way: A Data Perspective by IntoTheBlock\r\n",

There\u2019s a blockchain for everything - from cloud storage (Siacoin) to identity verification (Civic). But the original point of Bitcoin, the very cryptocurrency was to overturn the traditional banking system. An interestingly named token - Bread, is here to bring us back on track for this original goal. Bread technology intends to reinvent and revolutionize banking as we know it. By building a blockchain synced, Bitcoin-based wallet, the idea here is to decentralise banking and make it accessible to everyone.\r\n\r\nWith a blockchain connected, easy to use Bitcoin wallet, Bread makes it easy for you to transition to a truly decentralised banking service.It also provides portfolio management tools to offer a comprehensive banking experience. Purchases made using its BRD token attract loyalty points and rewards, giving customers another lucrative reason to use the Bread wallet app.\r\n\r\nBread was officially launched in 2014 itself and even raised VC funding to the tune of $7 million in August 2017. It then went the ICO route in December 2017, where it made available 88 million BRD tokens. $32 million was raised in the price, with BRD being valued at the rate of 900 for every 1 ETH at the time. As of June 2018, just over 6 months later, its value had fallen to above 1600 for every 1 ETH.\r\n\r\nA decentralised banking system was Bitcoin\u2019s original vision that is either taking too long to fruition, or we\u2019ve become an impatient audience. Whatever the case, Bread wants to accelerate the transition. A significant decision the Bread team took was to introduce the BRD token - which, with its cheap rates and loyalty/discount offerings, may emerge as the primary incentive for users joining the platform. If this is indeed the case, expect a spike in the value of the BRD cryptocurrency, something investors right now would be eyeing closely. Having said that, its fall in value since the ICO is certainly a cause for concern, and investors are advised to do their research and analyse before taking decisions.",

If memory plays an essential role in shaping us, then the truth is that memory is by its very nature a partial thing, and only media such as images, sound and texts enable us to keep and remember our past. These supports also allow us to transmit memories to succeeding generations so that they can continue to celebrate the memory of those who have left. Memories are therefore precious goods that we must be able to treat as such. The paradox of the last few decades is to have succeeded in democratizing, thanks to digital technology, the production of memory-supports in an almost unlimited way, while at the same time having failed to offer solutions to preserve them over time. Indeed, it has become increasingly difficult to store all the data we create about our lives in a secure and reliable way. A USB key or a hard disk can be easily lost; storage clouds do not guarantee a strong respect for privacy; printed photos see their colours fade, etc... Added to this is the difficulty of automatically and reliably transmitting them to third parties. How can we be sure that this video of myself, stored in some cloud, will be transmitted in 30 years, or after my death, to a loved one? In response to these needs, Capsule Corp. is developing the Ternoa Blockchain.

        "description": "Cardstack is an open-source framework and consensus protocol that makes blockchains usable and scalable for the mass market, creating a decentralized software ecosystem that can challenge today\u2019s digital superpowers. Cardstack Token (CARD) is a utility token allowing end- users and businesses to use applications that interact with multiple blockchains, decentralized protocols, app-coin-backed dApps, and cloud- based services while paying a single on-chain transaction fee. \r\n\r\nThe main value proposition of the Cardstack ICO is to breakdown the user experience of disparate software, cloud and blockchain silos which now exist on various levels of the digital world, allowing both developers and users to engage in customizable workflows. To overcome these disparate app silos, Cardstack offers a new UI, deployed via the web or as a peer-to-peer app, which turns each service created by open-source developers into a \u201ccard\u201d. Each card comprises a visual embodiment of key information, whereby users can then connect related cards for any type of workflow or utility they desire. These cards are the point of interaction between local services, cloud-based services and blockchain services all on one interface called Cardstack Hub. Underlying the Cardstack ecosystem is the Cardstack Token (CARD), an Ethereum-based ERC20 token.\r\n\r\nThe Cardstack Team comprises many open source contributors. Check out the full list of contributors here. Heading the development of Cardstack is Christopher Tse. Christopher holds a BSc in Computer Science from Columbia University and is the Co-Founder of Monegraph and dotBlockchain Media. He has also served as Senior Director of Innovation at Businessweek. Ed Faulkner is the Lead Developer at Cardstack. He holds a Master of Engineering in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from MIT. He has founded three of his own tech ventures of which all are currently operational. Hassan Abdel-Rahman is the Lead Blockchain Developer for Cardstack. He holds a BSc in Computer Science and Mathematics from Colorado School of Mines. Previous roles include over 2 years as Senior Software Designer at Monegraph and Principal Engineer at McGraw-Hill Education.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important features Cardstack will deploy is an entry channel payment system that does not require users to purchase cryptocurrency from an exchange. Users can simply pay with fiat, such as a credit card, to purchase CARD tokens directly on the platform, bypassing the need for any prior familiarity with crypto. Once users purchase CARD tokens, they are stored on a native wallet accessible from the Cardstack Hub. CARD tokens held in the native wallet are then used to purchase SSCs for every app and service they users with to access. To make any project appealing to the mass consumer market, this type of simplified entry into the cryptospace is a necessity. Cardstack have made some progress on the development front. The code for over 30 initial modules on the Cardstack platform has been made available via their Github. Also, the Solidity code for the Scalable Payment Pool has already been open-sourced. The Scalability Payment Pool is one of the core back-end mechanisms of the platform that issues rewards to developers for their work.\r\n\r\nCardstack aims to create an economically-sustainable software ecosystem that avoids the problems of today\u2019s centralized platforms. It\u2019s an \u201cexperience layer\u201d for the decentralized internet of the future, allowing users to combine services across cloud apps and decentralized apps. The ecosystem revolves around the use of Cardstack tokens, or CARD.",

        "description": "What is CENNZnet?\r\nCENNZnet is a New Zealand built public blockchain network which powers decentralised applications (DApps) and the crypto currency CENNZ and CPAY. It's a user-first dapp platform which makes blockchain based services accessible for first time builders and end users so that everyone can enjoy the increased network transparency, data privacy and reliability that decentralisation offers.\r\n\r\nHow does CENNZnet work?\r\nThe dual token economy\r\nCENNZnet uses a unique dual token system in order to help developers, users and token holders get the best from the network.\r\nCENNZnet has 2 tokens:\r\nCENNZ - the staking token which works separately to block rewards. This means it can increase in value without impacting the cost of using the network. This is important so the price of CENNZ can continue to increase without impacting the amount developers and users pay to use DApps.\r\nCPAY is the gas in the network and is used to pay transaction fees. It is also a block reward payment in staking. It\u2019s designed to be algorithmically stable, so it will retain a steady value. This means developers creating DApps on the network can easily predict the cost of their application, and stakers can easily predict the value of their stake.\r\n\r\nConsensus mechanism: Proof of Stake\r\nCENNZnet uses a Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. This is where node operators hold, or stake, their tokens in a particular wallet as collateral against their promise to perform their duties correctly. If they do perform their duties correctly they receive a reward in our CPAY token. If they do not then the staked tokens are slashed, or fined. Other token holders can also stake their tokens against node operators (validators) of their choosing in order to receive a portion of the CPAY reward.\r\nThis system helps to secure the network by incentivising the community to follow protocol and prevent attacks.\r\n\r\nGovernance\r\nCENNZnet functions 100% on-chain using blockchain\u2019s built in voting mechanisms. In CENNZnet governance, validators and node operators are required to vote on proposals using a direct voting mechanism (similar to direct democracy) to achieve consensus. Voting results are governed algorithmically and their automatic execution is built directly into the protocol. The winning decisions then automatically integrated into the chain.\r\nCENNZnet pre-built runtime modules\r\nDApp builders have access to core CENNZnet modules which provide the building blocks to common functions required for DApp users.\r\n\r\nNFT\r\nUsing the CENNZnet NFT module users can mint and sell NFTs on CENNZnet without ever needing to touch a smart contract. Instead, they can create custom NFTs using just a Javascript API or point and click with a UI.\r\n\r\nCENNZX\r\nCENNZX is a spot exchange module which enables a seamless fee payment experience on CENNZnet and makes token exchange instant and easy. The CENNZX Spot eliminates rent extraction and centralised services while prioritising decentralisation, usability and security.\r\n\r\nGeneric Asset\r\nGeneric Asset protocol enables CENNZnet\u2019s multicurrency economy. The module allows transaction fees to be paid in any asset, provided there\u2019s liquidity in the CENNZX in-chain GAS exchange. CENNZX will then seamlessly convert the asset into the official gas token, CPAY. This streamlines onboarding and in-app experience by eliminating the need for new users to learn about different token types and simply opting for their favoured currency.\r\n\r\nDoughnut\r\nThe Doughnut module is the secret sauce of the CENNZnet blockchain. Doughnuts are proofs of delegation between two or more cryptographic keypairs. They allow us to prove that one address delegates something to another address and allows permissions and rules to be carried between different networks without the need for a centralised server.

Chirpley will provide marketers with the freedom to act fast and effectively, thanks to the possibility of a 1-click marketing bomb.\r\n\r\nProduct\r\n\r\nChirpley is an independent and fully decentralized marketplace to match brands and businesses with nano (1\u20135k followers) and micro-influencers (5\u201350k followers). Brands have been slow to realize that targeting smaller influencers is more lucrative, as their engagement level is almost 600% higher than for big influencers\u2014Chirpley allows exactly this by giving both brands and influencers free access to its platform to connect.\r\n\r\nProblem\r\n\r\nFor brands and businesses, running influencer campaigns manually is extremely time-consuming and inefficient. Furthermore, it is difficult for brands and businesses to understand how much they should pay influencers to promote their products and services.\r\nFor nano and micro-influencers, way less opportunities exist than for big and well-known influencers. Further, smaller influencers often get compensated in companies\u2019 goods and services, rather than cash.\r\n\r\nSolution\r\n\r\nChirpley is the world\u2019s first decentralized peer-to-peer influencer marketplace. A decentralized ecosystem powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning, which matches nano and micro-influencers with brands.

The protocol achieves this through constantly analyzing and learning how nodes interact with their neighbors.\r\n\r\nHow Does the CORE Protocol Attract People?\r\n\r\n\u2022Lightweight\r\n\u2022Compatible with the self-interests of each peer, or ability to select the best neighbors\r\n\u2022Robust against adversarial actions: A CORE peer does not need all details about a candidate neighbor to decide whether to connect\r\n\u2022Incentivizes peers to relay blocks promptly.\r\n\u2022Naturally adaptive to varying hash-power\r\n\r\n\r\nCore Multi-Chain is the next generation of blockchain protocol designed to enable legacy, current, and future blockchains to scale and communicate seamlessly. CORE offers a wide variety of possibilities in the blockchain space due to its sharding, interoperability, and central algorithm.\r\nBy providing a fair and secure platform, CORE allows users to regain control over their personal information. The project offers a scalable network featuring functionalities that bypass current blockchain limitations. CORE intends to provide an environment-friendly system that is sustainable, interoperable and provides enhanced throughput. \r\n\r\nHighlights\r\n\u2022Network Efficiency \u2013 CORE contains an AI model at the core of its blockchain. This AI Model speeds up the network\u2019s collective transaction processing times and also enables the network to operate under attacks or faults. \r\n\u2022Security \u2013 The AI model helps coordinate the nodes on the network while also strengthening security on the CORE blockchain. This is accomplished through the network\u2019s outlier detection protocol, which monitors for unusual behavior. The AI randomly selects nodes to test and gather data, monitoring network activity outside of the norm. In this phase, any corrupt nodes will be identified. \r\n\u2022Transaction Privacy Protection Layer: CORE transaction privacy protection layer (TPPL) adds an extra layer of security and privacy when transacting on its blockchain. This universal layer is applied to every CORE-connected chain and can be applied to the major public blockchains.\r\n\u2022Randomness \u2013 The CORE Multi-Chain network combines Verifiable Random Function (VRF) and Verifiable Delay Function (VDF) into a single hybrid solution, thus achieving true Randomness within the network. Randomness influences the difficulty in the mining function of PoW blockchains and periodically chooses the validators in a PoS blockchain.\r\n\u2022Scalability \u2013 To address the scalability issue of Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance, CORE enhanced the consensus mechanism by reducing the communication complexity within standard PBFT implementations to create the Accelerated Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (APBFT) consensus mechanism.\r\n\r\nToken Usage\r\n\u2022Through the CMCX token, users can conduct transactions on the CORE blockchain and pay for all utility fees within the ecosystem. Platform users can use the token to participate in governance, stake, transactions, smart contracts, and reward validators.\r\n\u2022Core\u2019s mission is to serve the community. Users can vote for management and developer teams using the native token CORE (CMCX). The CORE community provides projects funding. Users will vote on any proposed changes to the blockchain or platform, creating a community-driven blockchain.\r\n\u2022Through CORE, all blockchains, past and present, will be able to scale and communicate seamlessly with one another by utilizing the CMCX token. \r\n\r\n\r\nMulti-Layered framework design: \r\nCORE is constructed over three layers; ORIGO, CATENA & AURA. Each layer is designed perfectly to get the job done.\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGO is the network layer. It is the brain of the system. It handles the formation of the blocks in the blockchain. \r\nCATENA is the blockchain layer and is built on the network layer. This is where the actual blocks form and newly formed blocks are appended.\r\nAURA is the application layer; this is where the DApps and smart contracts are built. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApeirogon blockchain framework\r\nCORE Blockchain combines all the latest frameworks and advanced programming languages into one cutting-edge solution to get more technical. \r\n\r\n\r\nIt is built on our in-house Apeirogon blockchain framework, a next-generation framework for enterprise-grade blockchain innovation that is highly compatible with Solidity.\r\nApeirogon is compiled to WebAssembly (Wasm), a super-performant virtual environment that provides a way to run code written in multiple languages on the web at near-native speed.\r\nApeirogon\u2019s ecosystem uses a state-of-the-art peer-to-peer network platform called LibP2P, a modular system of protocols, specifications, and libraries that enable the development of peer-to-peer network applications and is positioned to be the standard for future decentralized applications. \r\n\r\n\r\n Advantages\r\n\u2022Extensive research & value proposition to current blockchain limitations: The Whitepaper available on the Multi-chain website provides an in-depth yet accessible presentation of the responses provided by the team to solve current limitations on scalability, network efficiency, overall security, and reward fairness. CORE Multi-Chain Whitepaper accessible here.\r\n\u2022Security audits available: An audit of the network performed by CERTIK is currently public on the CORE Multi-Chain website. This research documents the project\u2019s performance in the following criteria: Security, Runtime, Documentation, Testing, General, and Transparency.  ",

CNS is a Binance Smart Chain-based token that serves as the Centric Network\u2019s on- and off-ramp. Centric Network itself is a dual-cryptocurrency payment network.\r\nCNS can be traded freely on cryptocurrency exchanges and offers users access to Centric Rise (CNR) along with liquidity. A decentralized protocol governs the exchange between these tokens and self-regulates the supply to meet the changes in demand.\r\nThe vision of Centric is to alleviate what they see as the largest obstacle to the mass adoption of cryptocurrencies, which is price volatility. The Centric Foundation was established to advance the adoption of Centric Rise (CNR) and Centric Swap (CNS).\r\nCentric has a dual-token model that rewards adoption and stabilizes over time due to its self-regulating supply. The idea behind the model is that, when a user purchases Centric Swap from a trusted cryptocurrency exchange, they can convert it to Centric Rise and benefit from its hourly growth.\r\nThis leads to the fact that at every moment when the Centric Rise is worth slightly more than Centric Swap, the user can convert CNR back to CNS and reap the rewards. This dual token system creates the conditions for a synthetic stable currency and can regulate the supply of Centric Rise to drive the market price of Centric Swap towards $1.\r\n\r\nWhat Makes Centric Swap Unique?\r\n\r\nThe two tokens that make up the Centric dual-token model include the Centric Rise (CNR) and the Centric Swap (CNS).\r\nCNR trades at a fixed price and has hourly growth, while CNS trades at the price set by the market. At any point in time, Centric Rise can be redeemed for Centric Swap and vice versa.\r\nHolding Centric Rise grants a user predetermined hourly earnings on their investment in Centric Swap, ensured by the fact that the value of Centric Rise is constantly increasing in relation to Centric Swap. CNR trades at a predetermined price that is enforced by the Centric protocol and increases every hour when the protocol self-balances. 1 CNS will always convert to CNR at a fixed exchange rate of $1 USD of CNR.\r\nIn other words, Centric Rise (CNR) stores value, is a transactional currency, has a deflationary supply and an inflationary price and an hourly yield. Centric Swap (CNS) has liquidity, is traded on exchanges, has an elastic supply and a demand indicator. The Centric Protocol governs the token exchange, regulates the supply, is immutable, is censorship-resistant and is independently audited.\r\n\r\nHow Is the Centric Swap Network Secured?\r\n\r\nThe Centric Protocol is governed by the Centric Rise smart contract. CNR and CNS are based on the BSC blockchain\u2019s BEP20 standard.\r\nCentric Wallet is available where users can store their Centric Rise and Centric Swap. It has features that were specifically designed for these tokens.",

Coin creates an open financial system made up of decentralized solutions that empower consumers to execute financial transactions with freedom and ease.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Makes Up the Coin Ecosystem?\r\n\r\nToken\r\n\r\nThe Coin Ecosystem is powered by the $COIN token, a digital asset and network access token that enables holders to execute Coin smart contracts, stake interest, and execute governance rights. $COIN also represents a stake in the Coin protocol and is the voting currency for all proposed protocol and platform changes by the community.\r\n\r\n\r\nWallet\r\n\r\nCoin Wallet is an all-in-one decentralized cryptocurrency wallet, exchange, and AI assistant. Coin Wallet includes a native cryptocurrency wallet and exchange for users to store and swap popular digital assets directly with each other. Unlike many other decentralized exchanges, swaps can occur cross-chain across different blockchains including Bitcoin, Ethereum, ERC20 tokens, and more. \r\n\r\nCoin Wallet is non-custodial, lives in a browser extension, and is non-susceptible to hacks as users are the only people that have and can access their funds. For exchanging assets, Coin Wallet uses atomic swap technology to handle direct peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions across different blockchains.\r\n\r\nCoin's integrated artificial intelligence (AI) assistant transforms the traditional financial experience by highlighting and providing insights for blockchain-specific keywords on any web page. Additionally, the Coin AI enables users to execute transactions by simply typing a command in any input field.\r\n\r\nThe combination of decentralized P2P technology, cross-chain interoperability, and AI integration, creates a secure and unparalleled experience to help consumers easily manage their digital assets.\r\n\r\n\r\nSwap\r\n\r\nCoin Swap is a P2P cross-chain decentralized exchange (DEX) that is compatible with any Internet web browser. It utilizes the same atomic swap technology in the Coin Wallet excluding a native wallet and the Coin AI assistant \u2014 this enables users to connect their favorite Web3 cryptocurrency wallet (including Coin Wallet) without the need to install a browser extension.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho Are the Founders and Advisors of Coin?\r\n\r\nCoin is assembled from a diverse and experienced team of technology veterans spanning the information technology, financial, and blockchain industries.\r\n\r\nFounder and CEO Damon Nam is formerly an accomplished 17-year IT services professional at Microsoft. He held multiple management roles for the largest software company in the world and in his last role, was responsible for a $90M book of business as a Partner Program Director for Microsoft North America.\r\n\r\nCTO Byron Levels is an experienced 20-plus-year technologist who has worked for many Fortune 500 companies including Microsoft, Pepsi, and American Airlines to name a few. He has a strong background in developing and deploying enterprise applications.\r\n\r\nCoin is supported by a team of advisors who are the pioneers in AI and blockchain. They include founder and CEO of FetchyFox Christina Apatow, founder and CEO of Celsius Network and investor of VoIP Alex Mashinsky, and co-founder of the Augur prediction market and Ausum Ventures, Jeremy Gardner.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Makes Coin Unique?\r\n\r\nNative cross-chain interoperability\r\n\r\nNo more wrapped tokens. No more sending to multiple exchanges to swap tokens.\r\n\r\nUnlike many industry leading decentralized exchanges, one of the unique features of the Coin network is swapping directly between different blockchains. The Coin network leverages atomic swap technology and Hash Time Lock Contracts to handle direct peer-to-peer trustless transactions. This removes the need for custodians, middlemen, and escrow agents.

CyberVein is made to integrate the form of data economy in various aspects with the block chain technology as the core. Blockchain is the essence of a variety of technology integration into a State of a synchronous Machine (State Machine), using the characteristics of block chain technology to solve problems which cannot be solved in a traditional network. CyberVein also need to fully consider the model in the process of economics, architecture of applied mathematics, computer hardware and software technology. Its main purpose is to use the block chain technology to successfully serve the problem solving product/platform (BASS).\r\n\r\nThrough the analysis of the problems encountered in the design process of the existing blockchain technology, we also propose solutions to these problems. CyberVein is a underlying framework based on DAG and contains a programming language, the virtual machine, new smart contracts to build ecological chain system, the underlying blocks dedicated to and from the aspects of technical level and business level to solve the problem from the data value of the information age.\r\n\r\nThe business logic of CyberVein\r\n1. The value of passive data: passive data (such as Cookies) is not valuable in itself and only has the value to be exchanged.\r\n2. Definition of data exchange value: the exchange value of data needs to be defined by carrier and medium, which can be quantified to define data value and realize data transfer.\r\n3. The ownership of data: data is different from the ownership of the property rights and intellectual property rights. Data ownership is fundamentally to dominate the process of data, it can define the data owner distributing the data in detail, the capability of sharing, and delivered to the other party; At the same time, data ownership can also define the rights of data owners and tripartite users to create, edit, modify, share, and restrict access to data.\r\nThe three characteristics of CyberVein in the design of deep understanding and mining data can only improve the ecology of data value discovery.\r\n\r\nThe technical solutions of CyberVein\r\nCyberVein has the following technologies and innovative solutions proposed by multiple analysis to realize the design goal of CyberVein.\r\n1.A distributed ledger of DAG architecture.\r\n2.A smart contract programming language improved by CyberVein and a database virtual machine. \r\n3.A new consensus mechanism - PoC (Proof of Contribution)\r\n4.A new, inter-ecological smart contract architecture.\r\nOn the value of the data found in the process of using a DAG architecture of distributed books and a virtual machine with database functions, anyone can write the database and release smart contracts and Dapp, thus they can develop the data ownership of their value, data exchange format and data conversion function of rules.\r\n\r\nCyberVein programming language and virtual machine\r\nIn order to better achieve our smart contract outstanding performance, there are differences to the existing blockchain smart contracts. CyberVein will be in the development of the network at the same time, develop our own programming language Vein and Virtual Machine CBVM (CyberVein Virtual Machine). Vein language will take the Solidity as the foundation, at the same time, to improve the running mechanism with the help of some rich libraries about database operations, realize functions such as definition method call price. \r\nVein language will help in the existing smart contract writers blockchain migration, and CyberVein will release documents to help developers get started faster.\r\nCBVM defines the data value in ecological and metastasis, and provide safe and reliable high-performance smart contracts running environment. CyberVein virtual machine in addition to used to run the smart contract, will also be a database operation system. Unlike traditional database, the database in CBVM sandbox is more like a database, and the operation of each node of the virtual machine will have independent sandbox, ensure data or use condition does not affect chain is affected.\r\n\r\nCyberVein new consensus algorithm: Proof of Contribution\r\nCyberVein, like all blockchain technology, is driven by motivation of safe mode. In the traditional blockchain mining consensus, it is based on the choice of total difficulty of highest blocks. Miners and others to the blocks. In most of the consensus standards, only containing a given difficulty of work experience (PoW) of blocks are valid.\r\nThere\u2019s no mining mechanism in the DAG architecture because there is no miner concept.

This flexibility ensures that CZUSD can adapt to market conditions and maintain a stable value in relation to USD.\r\n\r\nIn the future, CZUSD plans to continue evolving and expanding its offerings within the CZODIAC ecosystem.

This allows people to list NFTs for sale, auction, or pawn. It also means buyers can get great deals on NFTs that have been repossessed by lenders, who are now looking to cash in on the digital asset they have gained.\r\n\r\nDeFi For You will be launching lending pools in Q1 2022 to increase the value of its DeFi platform.

        "description": "Digix makes it possible to buy gold in an efficient manner via cryptocurrency by providing investors with a tokenized version of gold so you don\u2019t have to physically own or store it. Digix has two cryptocurrencies, Digix Gold (DGX) and DigixDAO (DGD), each of which serves a key role in the structure.  The company proudly gets 99.99 percent of its gold from LBMA-approved refiners, with zero percent from fractional reserves, delivering confidence. With Digix, investors can take advantage of the stability and value of gold as well as the ease of cryptocurrency. Digix essentially tokenizes gold within Ethereum. It takes advantage of the Distributed Ledger\u2019s immutability, auditability, and transparency, applying all these benefits to the precious physical asset of gold. Additionally, Digix has developed multiple technologies, such as the DGX tokens and introduced a new Proof of Asset protocol (POA).\r\n\r\nA key feature of Digix is its physical gold bullion. By investing, users buy bullion from the LBMA refineries, including the Assay Certificates from refiners like Nadir Bullion, PAMP Suisse, Valcambi, and others. For security, Digix includes third-party auditing from Bureau Veritas. Every quarter, it audits each gold asset within the safehouse vaults. This auditor has been in business since 1828 and is a world leader in certification, inspection, and testing services. With such a long track record, investors should be able to trust Bureau Veritas for their auditing services. Finally, Digix involves recast, which means customers can take their DGX delivery at the partnering custodial vault. \r\n\r\nDigix incorporated in Singapore in December 2014 and the DGD crowdsale took place on March 30th, 2016. It was the first ever crowdsale and major Distributed Autonomous Organization hosted on the Ethereum network. The sale intended to run for 30 days but met its 5.5 million dollars hard cap in just 12 hours, selling 1.7 million DGD tokens and reserving 300,000 for the Digix team. Pledges who sent over 15,000 USD worth of Ether received a special badge which will allow them to submit proposals to the DigixDAO. For better or worse, when you see the word DAO, you might think of hacking. In July 2017, over 4000 DGD were indeed stolen due to a vulnerability in the crowdsale smart contract. The bug was eventually fixed and the tokens reimbursed to the 35 affected addresses.\r\n\r\nIn January 2018, the vast majority of the cryptocurrency market crashed. DGD was the only coin in the top 100 to rise in value in that time. Perhaps this is an early indicator that people will seek gold as a safe haven during times of market uncertainty. The ICO price of DGD was about 3 dollars, but in 2018, DGD reached an all-time high of over 400 dollars. When Digix finally delivers the DGX tokens and the rewards to DGD participants start rolling in, we might see an even higher demand for DigixDAO. When DGX goes live, it will be available for purchase with Ether on the Digix marketplace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The marketplace covers a wide variety of games and turns virtual items into real commodities that can be traded on the blockchain. \r\n\r\nThe idea of tokenization is central to the blockchain where any item can be represented as a token on the blockchain. This creates an emerging economy around digital assets where they become real items. There are an estimated 2.3 billion gamers worldwide and ample opportunity to monetize digital assets. The gaming economy is estimated at $450 billion\r\n\r\nThere are two types of assets available on DMarket. The first type is a virtual Steam item. This Steam item is an in-game asset this is available for a specific game. At the moment there is a horde of items available for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. There is also a DMarket Blockchain item that is an internal blockchain item that can be traded on the DMarket blockchain.\r\n\r\nUsers can sell Steam items for US Dollars (USD) or DMarket items for USD or DMC, the internal DMarket cryptocurrency. Users can buy Steam items for USD or DMC or DMarket items for DMC. In order to sell Steam items on DMarket, users have to connect their Steam account to their DMarket account. DMarket blockchain items can be traded without connecting to Steam. Users have to register on DMarket. This creates a DMC wallet for them where they can store their DMC currency and DMarket items. The DMarket platform also has its own block explorer. All wallets and transactions are recorded in the public blockchain. \r\n\r\nDMarket has a future-proof use case as the demand for a universal gaming trading platform is imminent.

        "description": "The district0x network is a collective of decentralized and autonomous marketplaces and communities, also known as districts. These districts are built upon a decentralized and distributed open-source framework, the d0xINFRA network, which is powered by Ethereum smart contracts. The district0x network aims at creating a friction-free, virtual economy where the users will be able to make buying and selling decisions, complete transactions, and even rank their peers with just one simple click. District0x aims to develop a flexible, and free market with advanced entrepreneurial concepts.\r\n\r\nThe District0x infrastructure has a very neat concept with some well-outlined features, such as the staking interface. A staking interface is put in place that allows DNT holders to have open control over the districts through an Aragon governance layer for all markets that come online. Post creation of a district, an Aragon entity will also be created that people can use to interact with this staking mechanism. After staking a user will receive voting rights in that district.  Using the creation interface, one can remove central power structures from any marketplace without the additional need for development or programming skills. It can be described as the WordPress of dApps where the districts being launched are like wordpress templates and the auxiliary modules are WordPress plugins for extended functionality.\r\n\r\nWhile it is very difficult to buy lesser known cryptocurrencies using fiat currencies (dollars, euros) directly from crypto-exchanges, district0x or DNT can be easily purchased from various exchanges using Ethereum or Bitcoin as the base cryptocoin. Binance is one of the popular exchange platforms that can help trade Bitcoin or Ethereum for District0x. One can use various wallets like myetherwallet.com to store the district0x (DNT) coins. Coinbase, Blockchain, Exodus, Trezor Hardware Wallet are also wallets that supports district0x.\r\n\r\nDistrict0x, differs from most coins in its underlying concept and the architecture it is built on. The concept of interconnected districts and marketplaces promises a novel structure to the modern economies. What a lot of users are missing out on is the fact that it is a staking mechanism and not just a voting token. Staking is basically the process of mining the PoS (proof of stake) coins. Early investors will be able to lock their tokens to a specific district on the network, thus being able to participate in its governance later. DNT tokens can be staked in districts, thus they not only give voting power and privileges within that district but also provide district-specific tokens depending on when the investor had started trading. For example, early investors of the PoS token will be able to make decisions about the distribution of profits among stakeholders, the intricacies of the business model etc. DNT can basically be considered as a dynamic stock in the future district0x ecosystem.\r\n\r\nBy joining the district0x, the user receives district0x coins. They allow the owner to exercise the right to vote for district proposals and make decisions within certain districts. This includes, for example, voting on proposals concerning the future of a particular district or setting fees. The scope of shareholders\u2019 rights is outlined in the bylaws and varies according to the specific scope and purpose of each district. District0x platform users can interact with the functions and services provided by each district. Users can also freely create their own districts. For example, on Ethlance, the first district in the District0x network, users can post job offers or search for new jobs.",

Introduced as a \"joke currency\" on 6 December 2013, Dogecoin quickly developed its own online community and reached a capitalization of US$60 million in January 2014. Compared with other cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin had a fast initial coin production schedule: 100 billion coins were in circulation by mid-2015, with an additional 5.256 billion coins every year thereafter. As of 30 June 2015, the 100 billionth Dogecoin had been mined. \r\n\r\nDogecoin was created by Billy Markus from Portland, Oregon and  Jackson Palmer from Sydney, Australia. Both wanted to create a fun cryptocurrency that will appeal beyond the core Bitcoin audience. Dogecoin is primarily used as a tipping system on Reddit and Twitter where users tip each other for creating or sharing good content. The community is very active in organising fundraising activities for deserving causes.\r\n\r\nThe developers of Dogecoin haven\u2019t made any major changes to the coin since 2015. This means that Dogecoin could get left behind and is why Shibas are leaving Dogecoin to join more advanced platforms like Ethereum. One of Dogecoin strengths is its relaxed and fun-loving community. However, this is also a weakness because other currencies are way more professional.\r\n\r\nTo purchase Dogecoin, it involves downloading a crypto wallet, setting up a crypto exchange account and then trading away for your desired crypto currency. Once we have set up an account with a DOGE currency exchange and deposited some funds, you are ready to start trading. ",

Enigma wants to extend Ethereum Smart Contracts by introducing secret contracts, a brand of smart contract that gives users an element of privacy that\u2019s not intrinsic to current blockchain protocols. These contracts operate off-chain, meaning the execution of the Smart Contract doesn\u2019t occur on the Ethereum blockchain itself. This is how the Enigma protocol works: it breaks up the Smart Contract and any related data into pieces, encrypts those pieces, and distributes them redundantly among Enigma nodes.\r\n\r\nEnigma has a protocol level. The Enigma privacy protocol allows for decentralized computation of sensitive data. It has a platform layer too. On this protocol, dozens of platforms such as data marketplaces and AI exchanges can be built. In its application layer, it enables thousands of truly decentralized apps that require private computation and secure data.Its first application is catalyst. Catalyst is the first application to be built on the Enigma protocol, already active with tens of thousands of users. Catalyst is a revolutionary platform for data-driven cryptoasset investing and research, built for professional crypto traders.\r\n\r\nEnigma has a team of MIT graduates, and they\u2019ve been working diligently to ensure Enigma\u2019s success. Guy Zyskind, Enigma\u2019s CEO and cofounder, helped start the project while he was still a student at MIT. He has more than a decade of software development experience with an M.S. from MIT.

Enjin is the \u201clargest gaming community platform online\u201d with over 250,000 gaming communities and 18.7 million registered gamers. The Enjin team is designing the coin completely around gaming with the goal of it being the most usable cryptocurrency for the industry. The project includes the Enjin Coin as well as a suite of software development kits (SDKs) that developers can integrate into their games and communities. Bringing blockchain to gaming helps to reduce the high fees and fraud that\u2019s prevalent in the transfer of virtual goods.\r\n\r\nEnjin Coin is an ERC20 token built on the Ethereum network. With that, the project not only acts as a cryptocurrency but also has smart contract capabilities. It\u2019s also one of the first projects testing the Raiden Network, Ethereum\u2019s version of the Lightning Network. The Enjin Coin platform provides a laundry list of features through its public API and SDKs. To keep things brief, though, we\u2019ll only be discussing a few of the major ones in this article. The largest value Enjin Coin brings to the gaming community is in its creation and management of virtual goods. Developers on each platform can easily create a currency unique to their community that\u2019s backed by Enjin Coin as the parent currency. This gives the coins all the benefits of the blockchain (speed, cost, security, etc\u2026) while still staying customized to their respective platforms.\r\n\r\nEnjin, the company behind Enjin Coin, is the largest online gaming community creation platform. Started in 2009, the company receives 60 million views per month and transacts millions of U.S. dollars each month in their community stores. The team is deploying Enjin Coin across the entire Enjin CMS platform \u2013 over 250,000 gaming websites. Advisors to the project consist of Anthony Diiorio (Ethereum co-founder) and Pat LaBine (previous producer and technical director at Bioware). Enjin has also formed partnerships with Unity, PC Gamer, and NRG eSports. The team held a successful ICO in late 2017 in which they raised ~$35 million between the private and public rounds. Although it\u2019s still a young project, the team spent the last quarter of 2017 building the Platform API, Mobile Smart Wallet, and a Java SDK alongside creating a Minecraft plugin. They\u2019ve got plenty in store for 2018, but the highlights include various platform plugins, the Efinity release, and numerous other SDKs.\r\n\r\nEnjin also features a tool known as TopLists, which allow users to rank games, servers, teams and any other item. TopLists will be deployed as a decentralized smart contract with functionalities that will allow for market bidding or democratic voting. List creators are incentivized to promote and market their list because these creators will receive tokens when users perform tasks such as voting on their list. Enjin Coin is an ambitious project that aims to integrate online virtual gaming with decentralized technologies. Enjin Coin project promises a lot, and it is only with the passage of time that we will able to see if it can deliver on those promises.",

ENS also supports \u2018reverse resolution\u2019, making it possible to associate metadata such as canonical names or interface descriptions with Ethereum addresses.\r\n\r\nENS has similar goals to DNS, the Internet\u2019s Domain Name Service, but has significantly different architecture due to the capabilities and constraints provided by the Ethereum blockchain. Like DNS, ENS operates on a system of dot-separated hierarchical names called domains, with the owner of a domain having full control over subdomains.\r\n\r\nTop-level domains, like \u2018.eth\u2019 and \u2018.test\u2019, are owned by smart contracts called registrars, which specify rules governing the allocation of their subdomains. Anyone may, by following the rules imposed by these registrar contracts, obtain ownership of a domain for their own use. ENS also supports importing in DNS names already owned by the user for use on ENS.\r\n\r\nBecause of the hierarchal nature of ENS, anyone who owns a domain at any level may configure subdomains - for themselves or others - as desired. For instance, if Alice owns 'alice.eth', she can create 'pay.alice.eth' and configure it as she wishes.\r\n\r\nENS is deployed on the Ethereum main network and on several test networks.

In other words, the vision is to create a world computer that anyone can build applications in a decentralized manner; while all states and data are distributed and publicly accessible. Ethereum supports smart contracts in which developers can write code in order to program digital value. Examples of decentralized apps (dapps) that are built on Ethereum includes tokens, non-fungible tokens, decentralized finance apps, lending protocol, decentralized exchanges, and much more.\r\n\r\nOn Ethereum, all transactions and smart contract executions require a small fee to be paid. This fee is called Gas. In technical terms, Gas refers to the unit of measure on the amount of computational effort required to execute an operation or a smart contract. The more complex the execution operation is, the more gas is required to fulfill that operation. Gas fees are paid entirely in Ether (ETH), which is the native coin of the blockchain. The price of gas can fluctuate from time to time depending on the network demand.",

In the world of traditional finance, this process is typically facilitated by trusted and permissioned third-parties such as banks, who connect people with a surplus of money to those who need access to it in the short term. In the world of decentralised finance (DeFi), trusted and permissioned third-parties are no longer needed; banks have been replaced by trustless and permissionless lending protocols running on the blockchain (1).\r\nAmong the first-generation of DeFi lending protocols are Compound (2) and Aave (3). These protocols provide users with access to lending and borrowing capabilities for a handful of the most liquid ERC20 tokens. However, these protocols were not designed to handle the risks associated with lending and borrowing illiquid or volatile assets and have therefore relied on a permissioned listing system to protect their users from the risks associated with such assets.\r\nConsequently, there remains significant unmet demand for lending and borrowing the long tail of crypto assets. On the lending side, users want to deposit tokens to earn yield and take leveraged long positions. On the borrowing side, users want to reduce their exposure to volatility and take leveraged short positions. Here, we present Euler: a permissionless lending protocol custom-built with an array of new features to help users lend and borrow more types of tokens than ever before.",

Our mission is to build a consensus driven map of the world, empowering a fully decentralized web3 economy with verifiable location data. FOAM incentivizes the infrastructure needed for privacy-preserving and fraud-proof location verification. The starting point for FOAM is static proof of location, where a community of Cartographers curate geographic Points of Interest on the FOAM map. Through global community-driven efforts, FOAM\u2019s dynamic proof of location protocol will enable a permissionless and privacy-preserving network of radio beacons that is independent from external centralized sources and capable of providing secure location verification services.\r\n\r\nFOAM Token Functionality\r\n1. Add and Curate Geographic Points of Interest\r\nThe FOAM Spatial Index Visualizer allows Cartographers to participate in interactive TCR POIs on a map. Users can add points to the map, validate new candidates and verify the map by visiting real world locations. The FOAM Token Curated Registry unlocks mapping in a secure and permissionless fashion and allows locations to be ranked and maintained by token balances. Users can deposit FOAM Tokens into POIs on the map to increase attention those POIs might receive.\r\n\r\n2. Signal for Zone Incentivisation\r\nA further potential use of the FOAM Token by Cartographers is to stake their FOAM Tokens to Signal. Signaling is a mechanism designed to allow Cartographers to incentivize the expansion and geographic coverage of the FOAM network. To Signal, a Cartographer stakes FOAM Tokens to a Signaling smart contract by reference to a particular area. These staked tokens serve as indicators of demand, and are proportionate to (i) the length of time staking (the earlier, the better), and (ii) the number of tokens staked (the less well-served areas, the better). In the context of the contingent Dynamic Proof of Location concept (described further in the Product Whitepaper), these indicators are the weighted references that determine the spatial mining rewards.\r\n\r\n3. Contribute to Potential Secure Location Services as Zone Anchor or Verifier\r\nThe FOAM protocol may allow users to provide work and secure localization services and location verification for smart contracts and be rewarded for their own efforts with new FOAM Tokens in the form of mining rewards. Devices and real world contracts can be programmed to designate attestations and track interactions and transactions on the map. With the addition of necessary radio hardware by individual users and the grass roots expansion of the FOAM network, it may be possible for location status to be proved in a different manner. Location could be proved through a time synchronization protocol that would ensure continuity of a distributed clock, whereby specialized hardware could synchronize nodes\u2019 clocks over radio to provide location services in a given area. As explained further in the following paragraph, this \u2018Dynamic Proof of Location\u2019 is contingent on a number of factors outside of Foamspace\u2019s control.",

Node runners must deposit FORT Tokens to provide economic security for the work they are performing, since the staked FORT can be slashed if a node fails to execute their assigned work or performs their work maliciously. Once FORT is staked, it may only be withdrawn subject to a thawing period, which provides ample opportunity for verification and dispute resolution. Active node operators may earn rewards in FORT from the Network if they maintain the minimum stake and emit alerts and execute their assigned work correctly.\r\n\r\n2) Delegated staking: FORT holders have the possibility to delegate to scan node pools. This action improves the security of the network and enables delegators to participate in the rewards distribution. \r\n\r\n3) Minimum Bot Stake Requirement. The purpose is to protect the network from spam and malicious bots. Therefore there is a minimum stake required (100 FORT) for any detection bot to execute on the Forta network.\r\n\r\n4) Governance. While Forta is continuing to develop, including further evolution of community governance, it is crucial to maintain stability for Forta users that are relying on the Network\u2019s real-time monitoring. For that reason, Forta intends to decentralize governance over the Network progressively, beginning with a period of Council governance, where FORT holders are able to participate and vote to express their opinion and shape the evolution of Forta via Snapshot Voting.",

GNT believes that carbon neutrality can be reached by a commitment to measure, reduce, and finally offset carbon footprint. \r\nTo measure the GNT network carbon footprint, The \u201cGreenTrust Token model\u201d was developed. The model dynamically links the number of GNT transactions with the equivalent CO2 emission. \r\nTo reduce, and finally offset CO2 emissions, GNT team is committed to incept and accelerate initiatives along two main routes: Compensation and Reduction at the source.\r\n\r\nGreenTrust Token hence uses blockchain to align incentives of different stakeholders, developers and businesses towards green economy goals. It is based on the BSC-BEP20 network, with the consensus mechanism Proof of Staked Authority (\u201cPoSA\u201d) that ensures efficiency and performance in terms of speed and cost of transactions. The simpleness of the GNT contract, and the 0% fees policy, help in this sense, allowing users to transact GNT with a smooth IN/OUT process. The GNT smart contract was audited and verified by TechRate Audit company , passing all the checking status and without reporting security issues.",

        "description": "Holochain enables a distributed web with user autonomy built directly into its architecture and protocols. Data is about remembering our lived and shared experiences. Distributing the storage and processing of that data can change how we coordinate and interact. With digital integration under user control, Holochain liberates our online lives from corporate control over our choices and information.\r\n\r\nHolochain is an energy efficient post-blockchain ledger system and decentralized application platform that uses peer-to-peer networking for processing agent centric agreement and consensus systems between users.\r\n\r\nHolochain enables any device to have its own chain based ledger system. By using a holographic model for data storage and transfer developers can now create decentralized applications that can scale in multiple dimensions across a network ensuring they are truly distributed. This enables every device on a network to function independently, and only requires the synchronization of data when necessary, or agreed upon by users. This means every user is in control of their own data, and never has to risk their data being sold or exposed to 3rd parties like what just happened with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica.\r\n\r\nHolochain provides a framework for developers to build decentralized applications and aims to change the paradigm of data-centric blockchains to an agent-centric system. In Holochain\u2019s fledgling system, no true global consensus is maintained. Instead, each agent in the public blockchain maintains a private fork, essentially, that is managed and stored in a limited way on the public blockchain with a distributed hash table. This means there are no scalability limits and dapps hosted on Holochain can do much more with less of nearly everything than traditional blockchains.\r\n\r\nThis system however has some inherent weaknesses. Because the entire blockchain must be verified by each member of the network, scalability problems quickly develop. The larger the amount of data being handled, the more restrictive the limit of transactions per second that can occur on the blockchain at any one time.Holochain itself is open source and written in Go. Go was selected for its ease of use and similarity to C. Dapps written specifically for Holochain can be developed with JavaScript or Lisp, with support for front-end systems using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.\r\n\r\nThe developers added that Holochain is relatively flexible when it comes to handling new languages, so there is potential for growth on that front. Holochain bills itself as an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional blockchains. Because there is no need for each individual agent to store and validate the global blockchain, Holochain only consumes a fraction of the bandwidth of traditional chains. Holochain also does not have a mining component, so there\u2019s no electricity or processing power spent on proof-of-work calculations.\r\n\r\nArthur Brock and Eric Harris-Braun are the co-founders of Holochain and creators of Holochain. They have been designing alternatives currencies since the 80\u2019s and have been working on Holu since before the Bitcoin whitepaper was written. To protect the incentives of users, founders and developers, Holochain is owned by a non-profit foundation. he company\u2019s advisory team also includes Ryan Bubinski, the co-founder of CodeAcademy. In June, Holochain announced a new strategic partnership with Promether, an Adaptive Symbiotic Platform (ASP) that implements all the networking, security and anonymization code applications need to protect their data.",

        "description": "Huobi, the third-largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world, recently announced and launched a new currency. The Huobi Token (HT) rewards exchange users for their loyalty with lowered transaction fees while also carrying its own value in tradable pairs against popular currencies. The hope was to bring greater value to Huobi\u2019s millions of users, mostly located in Asian countries. The launch of the Huobi Token follows in the footsteps of other loyalty-building tokens that other exchanges have launched. The first and most successful of these tokens has been Binance Coin (BNB). The creation of BNB secured Binance\u2019s place as the world\u2019s leading exchange. It offered discounted trading fees in exchange for customer loyalty, primarily functioning as a loyalty rewards system.\r\n\r\nHuobi officially announced its intentions to launch a new token on January 22, 2018. Over the course of 15 days, Huobi would distribute 300 million HT (60% of the total supply) to its pro users who purchased a discounted service package. Each morning, a new batch of HT would become available on a first come, first served basis. Huobi declared this token distribution scheme, \u201cnot an ICO,\u201d due to the nature of the offering. Users are buying a specific service package, part of which includes HT that give a discount toward trading fees. The exchange launched the Huobi Token as part of an overall strategy to recover its user base after tightening regulations in China severely restricted cryptocurrency trading. In an interview with CoinDesk, Leon Li, Huobi\u2019s founder, revealed that Chinese rule changes had decimated the trading volume on Huobi by 95% between September 15 and November 1, 2017.\r\n\r\nThe HT token distribution began on January 24 and wrapped up on February 7, 2018. Each day of the distribution, millions of tokens sold out in mere minutes after going on sale. At that point, 300 million HT had been distributed to Huobi Pro members who bought packages. That\u2019s 60% of the total supply currently in public circulation. Another 200 million HT, 40% of the total supply, was set aside. 20% goes toward user rewards and platform operation. The other 20% is vested for four years and constitutes the team reward.\r\n\r\nHuobi isn\u2019t the first exchange to issue its own token. Binance (BNB), Bibox (BIX), KuCoin (KCS) and Coss (COSS) have all issued their own tokens as well.",

        "description": "The first two Impossible Finance products revolve around yield & autonomous community creation. Versus TradFi\u2019s low yields, defi yield protocols have been a killer app, but impermanent loss still looms large. Instead, focusing on low-IL asset pools such as EUR and JPY stablecoins, where central banks have negative interest rates, or non-dividend yielding synthetics (hint: high growth stocks don\u2019t have dividends) like synthetic TSLA, we propose the first wave of \u201cImpossible Yield\u201d products powered by our stablecoin swap, StableXswap. Taking a page out of Aave & Synthetix\u2019 playbook, this also encourages us to integrate many synthetic assets, lending protocols, and cross-chain solutions to aggregate liquidity. This yield generated from stable EUR, JPY, or TSLA pools is unbeatable by TradFi, at least until the ECB changes policies, the Japanese population pyramid inverts, or Elon Musk changes his website\u2019s FAQ.\r\n\r\nIn early 2021, we saw Wall Street Bets clash with Robinhood & hedge funds, putting emphasis on addressing retail users\u2019 needs without sacrificing user autonomy. Beyond avoiding business models that actively harm users (i.e. selling flow to frontrunners, or hiding spreads to mask fees), why would you ever accept dividendless holdings when defi can give you yield? That\u2019s Impossible Finance: we\u2019re hellbent on providing better financial instruments for the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second release of Impossible Finance products tackle crypto\u2019s best killer app: fundraising. In the wake of 2017 ICO scams, Vitalik posited DAICOs, (DAO + ICOs), where project teams could raise smart- contract vested funds, provided they achieve certain milestones. Governors determined whether the team was still building, or else refund investors. However, 2018 lacked robust governance and voting portals (i.e.snapshot.page), let alone real products to invest in. Today, we propose the launch of self-sustaining- initial-dex-offerings, or SSIDOs. With the power of yield from our AMMs and partner protocols, a team that raises $10M with a $2M burn rate can be self-sustaining with just 20% APY, creating a new raise once, build forever model. The Andre\u2019s of the world can find capital & liquidity and no longer need to rely on cexes and rent-seeking private investment funds to pay the bills. Meanwhile, vesting stable LP tokens from the fundraise stay within our AMM, which creates sticky TVL. Teams that raise via this system get automatically transparent banking, while traders get access to steady liquidity, anti-rugpull peace of mind. Our mission at Impossible Finance will be to continue finding win-wins for traders, investors, projects, and protocols alike.",

Additionally, users can utilize SelfKey to securely manage a crypto portfolio and instantly onboard immigration, cryptocurrency, and financial services. One of the unique aspects of SelfKey is its ability to work as an all-in-one identity solution for self-sovereignty. SelfKey utilizes a novel approach to identity management while also resolving the issues related to existing centralized identity management systems.

This lets you secure your identity documents and assets locally, so there is no risk of a major data breach as with other similar systems. The KYC processes within SelfKey also stand out for their efficiency. Qualified certifiers can provide you with reusable identity authentication upon request. You can then share this authentication multiple times with several service providers. This, in turn, prevents you from wasting time and effort with a traditional KYC onboarding process that is typically tedious. SelfKey additional minimizes data because of its blockchain-based verifiable claims protocol. This protocol lets you as an identity owner prove you meet the ID attributes required for a specific service or product without any need to actually share your identity document. In other words, you can provide proof of your ID without sharing the ID, keeping the data you send to a minimum. Of course, SelfKey also provides the full functionality you want from a cryptocurrency wallet, including the ability to securely manage cryptocurrency assets like ETH, KEY, and the other ERC-20 tokens.Edmund Lowell is the founder of SelfKey. \r\n\r\nOn his LinkedIn page, Edmund describes himself as an entrepreneur whose \u201cskill sets lie at the crossroads of finance, technology, and law/regulations.\u201d Additionally, he has been involved with other projects related to personal data protection, self-sovereign digital identity systems, blockchains, and distributed ledgers.

For example, $KILLER has already produced 3 songs from various artists from Colombia and the United States.\r\n\r\nMERCHANT PROCESSING PARTNERS\r\n\r\nCurrently, $KILLER is partnered with four different Crypto Payment Systems, and more will be added periodically. $KILLER also offers a \u201ctokens back\u201d reward system for its customers in order to achieve its status as a preferred token of payment.\r\n\r\nBURN = 99%\r\n\r\nFat Cat Killer launched with an initial 900 trillion-tokens supply and is executing an unprecedented, rapid burn to reduce total supply to 9 trillion tokens. The 99% burn is the highest of any token/coin in history, engineered to rapidly increase token valuation.\r\n\r\nSeven percent (7%) of token transactions will be burned. In addition, periodic Manual Burn events supercharge the burn rate. This feature (7%) is embedded into smart contracts, and can not be changed.\r\n\r\nNFT PLATFORM PARTNERS\r\n\r\nFat Cat Killer\u2019s catchy and creative brand lends itself for seamless integration into the NFT space. $KILLER is destined for heavy involvement in the NFT sphere using its own in-house production as well as our partnership with the Startup, [Duh!Art]\r\n\r\nAs part of our marketing strategy, it will select the best of the NFT\u2019s produced by our fat cat killer community and reward its most creative artists. Its partnership with [Duh!Art] utilizes the best platform to share its members\u2019 creativity with the world.

[Duh!Art]also agreed to use $KILLER as the preferred digital currency for their platform.\r\n\r\nCHARITY\r\n\r\nFat Cat Killer has a robust charitable mission. Although $KILLER is not a charity Token, it\u2019s testing the hypothesis that crypto can give opportunity to those afflicted by income inequality. To do this, it partnered with [Global Empowerment Mission], a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization founded in 2011 that has supported 295 missions in 28 countries, all 50 US states, and territories including the Caribbean.\r\n\r\n$KILLER chose [Global Empowerment Mission]as a third party administrator and auditor of its donation fund for many reasons, one of which is that they have [Guidestar] Platinum Seal of Transparency. Crypto investors can feel confident their donations are held accountable to fulfill their charitable mission(s).\r\n\r\nSTAKING / LOTTERY\r\n\r\n$KILLER\u2019s version of staking is its lottery system where investors can win a variety of coveted prizes. From an iPad to a luxury watch to increasingly luxurious items, nothing is off the table. Investors must lock their tokens for a short period of time to be eligible and winners are chosen randomly via its verified smart contract algorithm.\r\n\r\nSPONSORING & MULTIMEDIA BRANDING\r\n\r\nFat Cat Killer has been on the forefront of extreme sports by sponsoring multiple events like the Carolina Ski Race and more. $KILLER\u2019s Colombian roots gives it access to uses to integrate its own homegrown variety of Artists into its Multimedia brand. For example, Fat Cat Killer made a unique Music Video in Medellin, which is available on its YouTube channel.\r\n\r\nMore songs from other various artists will be added periodically.

Aave strives to break through the traditional bank loans system with a more efficient solution. Aave also uniquely allows a borrower and a lender to decide on important loan details that can eliminate the need of a middle man. Due to the elimination of middlemen, process fee for a loan does not exist on this platform. This provide convenience to any lender and borrower to create loans on their agreed terms. Decentralized lending has fixed many issues and one of the reasons why is the transparency of loan.\r\n\r\nThe Ethereum network provides a transparent ledger where all transactions are available to be inspected. Secondly, it isn\u2019t necessary to find a trusted loan provider because all collateral which is the digital asset for loans are stored and locked in a smart contract and broadcasted on the public ethereum blockchain. It is also flexible for borrower to manage the collateral by refilling or withdrawing part of it. Borrower may make such changes when the lender is notified and aware of such movement. If the lender finds out that the action is not communicated, the lender is allowed to initiate a margin call.  \r\n\r\nThis year, Aave has made a major upgrades in its Q1 2018. They have deployed the new development for their peer-to-peer lending application named Alpha 0.3. The development process of Alpha 0.3 has started since the early of 2017. The new release also includes a completely new user interface which targets to lower the learning curve of user experience on the app. Furthermore, the new user interface has new sections to make lending process simpler such as including a \u2018My Loan\u2019 section, collectible badges and more. Other than that, the team is also in the process of developing more updates for the smart contracts. Hence, the team has decided to provide zero-fee lending with the use of LEND token as a medium of exchange, as an alternative to borrowing in Ethereum. The purpose of this is to provide a cross-blockchain lending currency which will prompt users to use LEND as the medium of exchange. \r\n",

Inspired by LOL and DOTA, bringing the best 5v5 PVP Metaverse gaming experience to Android and iOS users\r\n\r\nLOA tokens can be obtained by: * Playing League Of Ancients * Staking into Ancient Realms\r\n\r\nWhat is the League of Ancients Gameplay?\r\n10 players will be thrusted into the Ancient Realm tile set map where they will engage in a 5v5 PVP team battle. The map is divided into two sides, the Luminous and the Dark Souls. The objective of the game is to destroy the base of the opposing team. Though it sounds simple, there are several layers of complexity to this. The map is vast and is focused around controlling lanes. Each lane leads to the opposing team's base and is guarded by endless waves of enemy minions and powerful turrets. Surrounding these lanes is the jungle and river which players can utilize strategically to hunt powerful creatures, escape, ambush and or navigate the map covertly. This PVP game style has been tried and tested for over 20 years, proving to be endlessly entertaining and exciting\r\n\r\nThere are 3 Game Modes:\r\n\r\nNormal Match Normal Match is the first and earliest game mode in League of Ancients. All other game modes use the mechanics of Normal Matches as their base. It is an UNRANKED 5v5 PVP experience. This means that players do not lose rank titles if they did not win the game. This mode is suitable for beginners who need to familiarize themselves with the gameplay mechanics. You are free to choose any hero to play with. However, you are not allowed to have more than one of the same hero on your team. The opposing team however, CAN pick the same hero that is chosen on your team. Players can earn in-game currency by completing each normal match.\r\n\r\nNFT Match NFT Match is a competitive seasonal game mode that runs for a specific period of time. You will be competing with other players sharing your ranked division bracket. Players will have access to play all the heroes as long as they have a certain number of NFT skins at any rarity level. The rank titles from lowest to highest are Sentinel, Royal Knight, Zealot, Duke, Arch-Duke, Lord, Overlord. Sentinel is the lowest division, whereas Overlord is for the best of the best. Every time you win a Ranked match, you will gain MMR and in-game currency. The amount of in-game currency will be higher compared to playing a normal match. When the season ends, the rankings will be reset accordingly and a new season begins.\r\n\r\nTournaments Tournaments is a feature of the game that allows organizers to host in-game tournaments. It will be supervised by League of Ancients. Each participating team has to pay a registration fee, where 5% of the total registration fee collected will be for the tournament organizer to cover for the administration purpose. The teams will challenge each other for the total prize pool allocated for that specific tournament. Prize pool consists of $LOA tokens\r\n\r\nHow Many LOA tokens Are There in Circulation?\r\nLOA token is scheduled for a TGE on December 12,2021 with 1 billion LOA tokens created at genesis with the following allocations: *Play-to-Earn: 25% *Staking: 15% *NFT Staking: 8% *Liquidity: 1% *Centralized Exchange: 5% *Ecosystem Fund: 3% *Marketing: 5% *Advisors: 4% *Community: 2% *Team Tokens: 20% *Private Sales: 10% *Pre-Sales and Initial Dex Offering: 2%\r\n\r\nWho Are the Core Team behind the League of Ancients?\r\nDwayne Ong - Governor (Project Lead) A crypto enthusiast and entrepreneur with experience in multiple startups of various industries.

        "description": "\"What Is LOCUS CHAIN (LOCUS)?\r\nLocus Chain aims to be the most widely used Next Generation Layer 1 Public Blockchain Protocol, which achieves both full decentralization and scalability simultaneously. As a decentralized scalable layer 1 chain based on patented technologies, Locus Chain aims to support various Defi, GameFi, Metaverse, Smart City, CBDC(Central Bank Digital Currency) projects by being the most reliable, secure, low cost and high performance layer 1 public blockchain platform. Locus Chain claims to be the first decentralized Layer 1 public blockchain to ever solve the blockchain trilemma of Decentralization. Scalability and Security.\r\n\r\nLOCUS token?\r\nThe current Locus token type before the mainnet is an Ethereum-based ERC20 token with smart contract issued by Locus Chain Foundation. However, given that the tokens on the public Ethereum network cannot be used on the Locus Chain directly, we will be making use of hashed time-locked contracts to allow 1-to-1 atomic swaps of Locus tokens from Ethereum to the Locus Chain mainnet. LOCUS will be the main cryptocurrency required for all the operations of the Locus Chain network and all of its applications. LOCUS is a payment method for the entire network economy. Tokens are used by validators (who can easily participate), developers, and users to participate in the LOCUS network and receive rewards. It is also used to for fees and to participate in future governance.\r\n\r\nLOCUS Ecosystem\r\nTop developers and high profile business partners are participating in the development of Locus Chain one after another. High-performance Layer 1 blockchain can create various business opportunities in sectors including decentralized finance, real estate transaction platforms, and game money, etc as well as creating various other tokens. In addition, Locus Chain allows the users to use the blockchain verification service through a simple linkage without building a separate blockchain. Since it is a high-performance public blockchain platform, technology licensing will be carried out in the future in the areas of CBDC and IOT, including smart cities, smart factories, and smart grids based on vast amounts of data.\r\n\r\nSpecial technology of LOCUS\r\n*DAG(Directed Acyclic Graph) - AWTC(Account-Wise Transaction Chain)\r\n\r\nThe AWTC, Account-Wise-Transaction-Chain, is a central data structure for Locus Chain's high capacity, distributed transaction processing. AWTC is a Directed-Acyclic-Graph (DAG) based data structure composed of multiple transaction chains, each for an account. Each account has its dedicated chain. A new transaction issued by an account is primarily added to the account's chain. Block grid structures, including DAG-AWTC, do not cause conflicts because there are as many points as the number of accounts to which the transaction is added, and only the owning account can record it exclusively. Also, the account that added the transaction becomes clear, so if the account holder himself is not a malicious user, the transaction is almost confirmed as soon as it is added. The ledger structure of the Locus Chain is one of the main technical features to fundamentally solve the problem of delayed transaction processing that the existing blockchains had.\r\n\r\nPOS - BFT Consensus Algorithm\r\nGiven the time required for the data to propagate sufficiently to the network, the Locus Chain first implemented a BFT definitive consensus on the DAG by attempting to consent on a small amount of historical points of time. It also selects a new proposer committee that participates in the consensus algorithm every round by a random verifiable function (VRF) based on stochastic PoS (proof of stake: the more shares, the higher the probability of being elected as a committee). Since these methods cannot identify or predict the nodes (proposer, validator) to participate in the consensus, manipulation by malicious attacks is difficult, ensuring fairness and network stability of the consensus results.\r\n*Verifiable Pruning\r\n\r\nUnlike traditional pruning, which reduces the size of a ledger by simply deleting old data to address growing ledger sizes, Locus Chain's Verifiable Pruninng uses a Skewed Merkle Tree structure to validate the legitimacy of the data even when most of the previous data is deleted in the local environment. Verifiable pruning deletes outdated data on the ledger while still being able to provide full data verification by verifying previous data with hash values.\r\n\r\n*Dynamic Sharding\r\n\r\nLocus Chain has a ledger structure formed of each account (AWTC), making it easy to adjust the number and size of the shard, and the validator ratio by relocating the shard in the event of an imbalance between shards. With dynamic sharding, the network usage that a node has to cover is reduced to 2/N when the number of shards is N. The total network TPS for network usage on the same node will increase by that amount, plus the additional ledger state sharding, which will also divide the storage usage by the number of shards.\r\n\r\nLOCUS\u2019S creators\r\nThe key development members of the Locus Chain were developers of the Blueside Engine, Korea's first commercial game engine. The core of Locus Chain technology is to effectively process and synchronize large amounts of network traffic. The developers of Blueside Engine have acquired 18 software development related intellectual property rights, which are the product of the technology accumulated through console/online games and software development over the past 20 years, and hold 2 other software patents.\"",

        "description": "LunaDoge is a DeFi meme token inspired by Dogecoin and reflect.finance. Two functions occur during each trade: static rewards and automatic liquidity pool (\"\"LP\"\") acquisition via transaction taxes. A 5% tax is applied to every trade for static rewards and a 5% tax is applied to every trade for automatic LP acquisition.\r\n\r\nStatic rewards are used to solve problems related to impermanent loss. The reward amount is conditional upon the volume of the token being traded. This mechanism aims to alleviate some of the downward sell pressure put on the token. Furthermore, the mechanism encourages holders to hold onto their tokens to obtain rewards from every LOGE transaction. The static rewards are proportionally shared over all LOGE holders and dependent on the total tokens held.\r\n\r\nAutomatic LP acquisition is a function of the contract that is beneficial for holders as the LunaDoge contract applies a 5% tax to every transaction of which half is sold to BNB (the asset paired with LOGE in the liquidity pool) and then the equal share of BNB and LOGE is added to the LP, creating an ever-increasing floor for the liquidity pool. As the liquidity pool increases, the price stability increases as well. The purpose of the automatic LP acquisition is to prevent big price swings when top holders sell or new investors want to enter the tokens without having to worry too much about slippage. The automatic LP acquisition creates a long-term benefit for the token and solves the prior issues related to static rewards, where rewarding holders was only beneficial in the short-term.",

In addition, Livepeer is meant to provide an economically efficient alternative to centralized broadcasting solutions for any existing broadcaster. In this document we describe the Livepeer Protocol - a delegated stake based protocol for incentivizing participants in a live video broadcast network in a game-theoretically secure way. We present solutions for the scalable verification of decentralized work, as well as the prevention of useless work in an attempt to game the token allocations in an inflationary system.\r\n\r\nThe Livepeer Token (LPT) is the protocol token of the Livepeer network. But it is not the medium of exchange token. Broadcasters use Ethereum's Ether (ETH) to broadcast video on the network. Nodes who contribute processing and bandwidth earn ETH in the form of fees from broadcasters. LPT is a staking token that participants who want to perform work on the network stake in order to coordinate how work gets distributed on the network, and to provide security that the work will get done honestly and correctly. LPT has the following purposes:\r\n\r\nIt serves as a bonding mechanism in a delegated proof of stake system, in which stake is delegated towards transcoders (or validators) who participate in the protocol to transcode video and validate work. The token, and potential slashing that occurs due to protocol violation, is necessary in order to secure the network against a number of attacks. More below.\r\nIt routes work through the network in proportion to the amount of staked and delegated token, essentially serving as a coordination mechanism.\r\n\r\nIt is a unit of account that is specific to the Livepeer ecosystem, which forms the basis of a SectorCoin concept, applicable to additional functionality to be introduced in the future. Services such as DVR, closed captioning, ad insertion/monetization, and analytics can all plug into the Livepeer ecosystem and potentially make use of the security provided by staking LPT.\r\n\r\nAn initial allocation of Livepeer Token will be distributed so that stakeholders can fulfill various roles in, and use the network, and then additional token will be issued according to algorithmically programmed issuance over time.\r\n\r\nFollowing the conventions of Ethereum and many popular ERC20 tokens, LPT will be divisible by 10 ^ 18, with larger denominations such as the LPT itself intended to be used for user level transactions such as staking, and smaller denominations intended to be used for protocol accounting.",

The result is that the cost per trade settlement is as small as $0.00015.\r\n\r\nLoopring's performance is sufficient for professional traders and market makers to deploy algorithmic strategies and other automated trading bots. This was not previously possible on any DEX as it was prohibitively slow and expensive. By building on top of Loopring 3.0, orderbook-based DEXs can be commercially viable for the first time.

        "description": "Litecoin is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency created by Charlie Lee. It was created based on the Bitcoin protocol but differs in terms of the hashing algorithm used. Litecoin uses the memory intensive Scrypt proof of work mining algorithm. Scrypt allows consumer-grade hardware such as GPU to mine those coins.\r\n\r\nWhy Litecoin?\r\nLitecoin is a cryptocurrency that has evolved from Bitcoin after its own popularity in the industry, this alternative, or \u2018altcoin\u2019 has emerged to allow investors to diversify their digital currency package, according to Investopedia. Litecoin is one of the most prominent altcoins and was created by former Google employee and Director of Engineering at Coinbase, Charlie Lee. Litecoin was the first to alter Bitcoin and the most significant difference is that it takes 2.5 minutes for Litecoin to generate a block, or transaction, in comparison to Bitcoin's 10 minutes.\r\n\r\n\u2018While this matters little to traders, miners who use hardware to run Bitcoin's network cannot switch over to Litecoin. This keeps bigger mining conglomerates away from Litecoin because they cannot easily optimize their profits by swapping to another coin, contributing to a more decentralized experience. Litecoin also has bigger blocks, and more coins in circulation, making it more affordable and swift when transacting,\u2019 Investopedia explained.\r\n\r\nAs explained above, Litecoin can transact a lot faster than Bitcoin, but there are also a number of other characteristics that investors need to know before trading. Litecoin can handle higher volumes of transactions because of the capability of transacting faster and if Bitcoin attempted to transact on the scale of its altcoin, a code update would be needed. However, Litecoin\u2019s blocks would be larger, but with more \u2018orphaned blocks'. The faster block time of litecoin reduces the risk of double spending attacks - this is theoretical in the case of both networks having the same hashing power.\r\n\r\nLitecoin Technical Details:\r\nThe transaction confirmation time taken for Litecoin is about 2.5 minutes on average (as compared to Bitcoin's 10 minutes). The Litecoin network is scheduled to cap at 84 million currency units. \r\n\r\nLitecoin has inspired many other popular alternative currencies (eg. Dogecoin) because of its Scrypt hashing algorithm in order to prevent ASIC miners from mining those coins. However it is said that by the end of this year, Scrypt ASIC will enter the mass market.",

The MCO Token Sale was conducted in May-June 2017 and raised US$26.7 million. \r\n\r\nMCO Card is a Visa-branded debit card that draws from a cryptocurrency-funded bank account. Since it\u2019s a Visa card, you can use your MCO Visa card just like you would any other card. The card and bank account are free for holders of cryptocurrency. In order to open an account, you simply sign up, verify your identity, and transfer any of the various accepted cryptocurrencies to your account. At this time, the Visa card is available to customers in Asia. They also have a waitlist for European customers. Customers in the United States does not have access to it at the moment. However, there are plans to change that. Solving the problem of everyday payments has the potential to be huge for cryptocurrency. However, MCO Visa card is not the only project attempting to create crypto-backed debit (or prepaid) cards. Other projects, such as TenX, are working on the same issue. All of these projects run into challenges implementing such cards in a large scale, compliant manner. Crypto.com hopes to crack the code, ultimately getting cryptocurrencies and popular payment methods to play nicely together.\r\n\r\nCrypto.com was founded in June 2016 in Switzerland and rebranded from Monaco on 6th July 2018. Their first prototype was developed in October of that year. In February of 2017, they were accepted into a Hong Kong Government backed Cyberport incubation program, where they developed their platform until they were ready to launch their token sale in 2017. The sale closed in June with $26.7 million in funding. Their app became available to pre-registered users in August 2017, followed by the official partnership with Visa in October. The team consists of seasoned veterans in the fin-tech space, most of whom have experience in Asia, where Monaco Cards have first been made available.\r\n\r\nSince MCO Visa cards are backed by cryptocurrency, they don\u2019t have border issues like fiat currencies. As a result, you can use your card anywhere you go. The card will automatically default to the local fiat currency when you make a purchase. The low fees and exchange rates also apply in other countries. Transactions take place at the exact exchange rate that Crypto.com receives as an institutional trader. In contrast, when you use your debit card across borders with most banks, they\u2019ll add an additional percentage to the exchange rate or include a transaction fee. Crypto.com has connections with eight of the top ten international foreign exchange banks to facilitate currency conversion.\r\n\r\nThe MCO Visa card is a compelling option for anyone looking to make everyday purchases with cryptocurrency. It also makes sense for cross-border travelers. However, we can expect the rollout to take a long time and hit a lot of bumps along the way. The financial industry is highly regulated and cryptocurrency-backed payments is a complex issue, even if Crypto.com's solution seems to make it simple and user-friendly.",

Its innovative new quantum-proof protocol, known as the Tangle, gives rise to unique new features like zero fees, infinite scalability, fast transactions, secure data transfer and many others. IOTA is initially focused on serving as the backbone of the Internet-of-Things (IoT).\r\n\r\nIOTA is a cryptocurrency that has no transaction fees and requires no miners in order to process transactions. It does, however, require some computational power to submit a transaction, making it perfect for machines to use as a currency and distributed communication protocol for the Internet of Things \u201cIoT\u201d. The main purpose of IOTA is to solve some of the major problems with Blockchain technology, the main one being that the bigger the Blockchain (such as Bitcoin), the slower, more expensive, and also more restricting it is to actually transfer funds. Another issue with the Blockchain is size, as more and more Blocks are added, the longer the Blockchain gets, and therefore the less amount of computers are able to mine it. Right now BTC is over 150GB long, and so is ETH. If this size increased tenfold, very few computers would be able to mine it at all.

        "description": "MKR is a cryptocurrency depicted as a smart contract platform and works alongside the Dai coin and aims to act as a hedge currency that provides traders with a stable alternative to the majority of coins currently available on the market. Maker offers a transparent stablecoin system that is fully inspectable on the Ethereum blockchain. Founded almost three years ago, MakerDao is lead by Rune Christensen, its CEO and founder. Maker\u2019s MKR coin is a recent entrant to the market and is not a well known project. However, after today it will be known by many more people after blowing up 40% and it is one of the coins to rise to prominence during the recent peaks and troughs.\r\n\r\nAfter being developed by the MakerDAO team, Maker Dai officially went live on December 18th, 2017. Dai is a price stable coin that is suitable for payments, savings, or collateral and provides cryptocurrency traders with increased options concerning opening and closing positions. Dai lives completely on the blockchain chain with its stability unmediated by the legal system or trusted counterparties and helps facilitate trading while staying entirely in the world of cryptocurrencies. The concept of a stablecoin is fairly straight forward \u2013 it\u2019s a token that has its price or value pegged to a particular fiat currency. A stablecoin is a token (like Bitcoin and Ethereum) that exists on a blockchain, but unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, Dai has no volatility.\r\n\r\nMKR is an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain and can not be mined. It\u2019s instead created/destroyed in response to DAI price fluctuations in order to keep it hovering around $1 USD. MKR is used to pay transaction fees on the Maker system, and it collateralizes the system. Holding MKR comes with voting rights within Maker\u2019s continuous approval voting system. Bad governance devalues MKR tokens, so MKR holders are incentivized to vote for the good of the entire system. It\u2019s a fully decentralized and democratic structure, then, which is an underutilized USP of blockchain tech.\r\n\r\nValue volatility is a relative concept among both cryptos and fiat currencies. The US dollar, for example, was worth 110.748 yen on July 9, 2018. On July 4, 2011, $1 was worth 80.64 yen, and on March 18, 1985, $1 was worth 255.65 yen. These are major differences in exchange rates, and inflation within each country makes each currency worth different values even when compared to themselves. One USD in 1913 is worth the equivalent of $25.41 today, and even $1 in 1993 is worth the equivalent of $1.74 today. Stablecoins don\u2019t negate these basic economic principles of value. Instead, both Tether and Dai have values pegged to the U.S. dollar. This is done to stabilize the price.",

Medicalchain provides solutions to today\u2019s health record problems. The platform is built to securely store and share electronic health records. By digitizing health records and empowering users we can leverage countless industry synergies.\r\n\r\nMedicalchain is building a platform for secure storage and utilization of electronic health records on the blockchain. The company is also building a telemedicine platform to allow users to directly connect with healthcare professionals, share their records and get consultations, second opinions, online through a secure channel.The company was originally founded in February 2016 to provide a software solution inside hospitals. The solution is known as \u2018Discharge Summary\u2019 and it uses a workflow tool to accurately write an assessment of a patient as they are being discharged from surgery or a long hospital visit. The software is currently being used by hospitals in UK and the team decided to extend this project and go further with Medicalchain. \r\n\r\nMedicalchain wants people to have access to their health records everywhere. Today, you can travel far and wide and you will have access to your phone, contacts, photos, files, bank accounts but not your health records - probably the most important and life saving information you need. In most developed countries around the world you, as a patient, have a legal right to request your records. Medicalchain is providing you with a platform to do that. But more importantly, Medicalchain wants its users to be able to use it immediately by communicating and sharing (on a time limited basis) with other doctors. The bigger vision is to allow pharmaceutical, insurance and other healthcare organisations and stakeholders to be able to interact with health records on patients' terms. Medicalchain believes that health records should be a part of everyone\u2019s life and not just referred to when someone is ill.",

Introduced the original paper as well as a revised version known as Black Paper. On the other side, a specific fund has been formed for members of this project to conduct various transactions with NCC digital currency, which may generate revenue for the project's participants.\r\n\r\nNetcoincapital  has already finished the first step of its road map, which includes AirDrop and entering the first exchange, and is now moving on to the second phase of its project. The company's wallet will be offered first in this phase of the project, followed by the blockchain that has been launched under the name of Azgard in the team's black paper, Existing blockchain systems should be reduced. However, due to the structure of the blockchain, it may be utilized as a platform for decentralized applications, even with greater display graphics. The card system can be employed in the project's next steps. Another consequence of this blockchain technology is the Silk Gateway, which is a digital currency payment gateway designated after certain credit institutions.\r\n\r\nNetcoincapital  has decided to incorporate artificial intelligence into another discipline of computer science and programming, taking into account the needs of the user, due to the complexity of programming projects in many languages used in this field. This programming language, which can be integrated with the Asgard blockchain technology to build a blockchain-based operating system that is entirely decentralized, will be able to do the programming code automatically using a very simple user interface.\r\n\r\nPreviously, This company has also conducted research in the field of programming, among which we may name source code linked to difficult linear algebra calculations, which is one of the services given by this company to programmers in the high-level Python language.\r\n\r\nBecause of the creation of blockchain, Netcoincapital's programming language and proprietary operating system will continue to be developed to leverage the blockchain operating system, which is the first step toward powerful processors and the utilization of power. This firm is developing a greater computational mind, a processor that, instead of using metals to process data, will use combinations of metals and specific chemical compositions to process data at a higher rate than present systems.\r\n\r\nanother goal that can be achieved Netcoincapital  Group examined the development of special devices based on proprietary processors and the blockchain operating system, announcing that these devices could be similar to today's smartphones, laptops, and tablets, with the exception that Blockchains are completely decentralized and have higher processing power on the platform.",

        "description": "ODEM, or On-Demand Education Marketplace, is a blockchain-based distributed network that allows university students to seamlessly interact with their professors and academic partners. Through the creation of nuanced digital channels, ODEM makes it possible for users to come together to raise the quality of accessible education at a reasonable cost. Additionally, the ODEM platform allows qualified and trusted individuals from across the global education scene to create customized curriculum that can help students gain practical knowledge about the market at large and allow them to gain hands-on experience within various industrial sectors. Not only that, ODEM provides students with more choices for housing, transportation, and other necessities, thereby allowing international as well as local students to take ownership of their educations.\r\n\r\nODEM connects students with various educational hubs via a smart contract-based payment platform. As a result, academic scholars can interact directly with one another and participate in the exchange of education and learning, without the involvement of intermediaries. This service allows users to access custom-designed courses and educational programs that can help them find a curriculum that meets their particular needs. Unlike the educational model used by online service providers such as Coursera and Khan Academy, where all teacher-student interaction is maintained virtually, ODEM creates customized in-person educational programs that prepare students for real-world jobs and businesses. According to the official whitepaper, the majority of ODEM\u2019s current offerings are onsite educational experiences.\r\n\r\nRichard Maaghul is the CEO of this venture. He has been in the startup domain for over two decades and has been involved with a number of emerging/disruptive technologies in the past. In addition to co-founding ODEM.IO, Rich has been involved with Chevron Corporation as an executive. William Bayrd II is the COO of this project. According to his LinkedIn profile, Bill is the founder of three companies, including big-name establishments such as Excelorators Inc. Bill possesses a D.Pharma from the University of Tennessee Health Science Center. Michael Zargham is the Chief Backend Engineer for ODEM. He holds a Ph.D in Systems Engineering with a specialization in decentralized systems. Also worth mentioning is the fact that Michael possesses more than a decade\u2019s worth of experience in domains such as digital systems and disruptive technology.\r\n\r\nTo invest in this company, we will have to buy its ODEM tokens. They are ERC20 Ethereum-based tokens which can be used on the educational platform to trade for educational services. You will be able to buy the ODEM tokens during the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) as the pre-sale was already finished in December 2017. The sale will begin on February 17 and it will last until March 19. We will be able to use ETH to buy the tokens and you can store them in any Ethereum wallet. The tokens will be distributed as soon as the sale is finished.",

Paxos was the first virtual currency company to receive a charter from the New York State Department of Financial Services. As a chartered limited purpose trust company with fiduciary powers under the Banking Law, Paxos is able to offer regulated services in the crypto-asset and virtual commodities space.\r\n\r\nThe Paxos team comes from a wide variety of backgrounds with a diverse array of experiences ranging from Wall Street to Silicon Valley. It\u2019s led by CEO and co-founder Charles Cascarilla, who has spent his career as a customer, analyst, investor and now creator of financial technology.\r\n\r\nPaxos describes itself as \u201cthe first regulated Trust company with blockchain expertise\u201d, and it is using that expertise to create a modern settlement solution that can eliminate risk and simplify settlements. What many people may not know about Paxos is that it was actually founded in 2012 as Paxos Trust Company, and that for most of its life it ran the cryptocurrency exchange itBit, which is still operates. The creation of Paxos was a pivot from an exchange platform to a company focused on creating a modern settlement platform using blockchain technology.\r\n\r\nPaxos has become the most widely adopted cryptocurrency in the fastest time frame, with support from over 20 exchanges and OTC desks in the first five weeks of its existence. It\u2019s been picked up and listed by six of the top ten cryptocurrency exchanges, Binance, OKEx, Gate.io, ZB, KuCoin and DigiFinex. These exchanges are offering PAX as an alternative to the controversial Tether. Unlike the controversy surrounding the people who control Tether, there is no such obscurity when it comes to the people behind Paxos. The CEO and co-founder is Charles Cascarilla. He has over 15 years in financial services and has co-founded Cedar Hill asset management back in 2005. He has also worked and Bank of America and Goldman Sachs prior to that.\r\n\r\nThe Pax Dollar (USDP) is the first digital asset to be issued by a financial institution and to be fully secured by the U.S. dollar. While other similar stablecoins have existed, there has been no proof of full U.S. dollar reserves, nor have these earlier assets been issued by a financial institution. The Paxos team has been fairly clear in declaring the different base that PAX is working from. ",

Physical and digital modes of course, include bank accounts, wallets, debit cards, cash and much more. The primary agenda of the company is to make it easier and faster to use cryptocurrency and accelerate adoption for the industry. The TenX blockchain supports the PAY token, which is the fuel that runs the network and is the cryptocurrency using which transactions on the network are made. \r\n\r\nTenX came into existence in 2011 and was created by Toby Hoenisch. While at the university, he took a keen interest in cryptography though he believed that there was no success for cryptocurrencies.In 2012, Toby started trading Bitcoin when he got to know a member of bitcoin-community who was not able to open an account in bank and used TenX crypto currency instead. Toby Hoenisch and Michael Sperk started a one-bit start up in 2015 and introduced us to a debit card, through which payments with bitcoin could be done. \r\n\r\nCryptocurrency adoption is a longstanding problem - with most cryptocurrencies remaining relegated to the realms of hype and not seeing real-world usage, not as much as the enthusiasts would like, at least. This is an important problem being solved by the TenX coin, which seeks to make it easy for the end user to use cryptocurrencies by removing the hurdles associated with keeping different wallets and using them separately. As with all other investments, it is wise to do your own research, but seeing that TenX seems to be solving unique problems, it may certainly be worth a look.",

Over 200 security tokens have been deployed using their Ethereum-based solution and they are now in the midst of launching Polymesh, an institutional-grade blockchain built specifically for regulated assets. Polymath streamlines antiquated processes and opens the door to new financial instruments by solving the inherent challenges with public infrastructure around identity, compliance, confidentiality, and governance. \r\n\r\nRecognizing that the industry lacked security-specific standards, Polymath spearheaded the creation of a unified standard for security tokens on Ethereum, ERC 1400. ERC 1400 acts as an umbrella of standards and is designed to address some of the challenges in managing security tokens by enabling the ability to conserve UBO rights for custodied assets, and automate transfer control (including KYC verification) and corporate actions (including capital distribution or voting). \r\n\r\nPolymath has brought forward many advanced innovations that address regulatory and market needs head-on. They have built a series of tools on the chain that offer non-technical users an intuitive means to access the chain\u2019s functionality, and are also in the midst of launching Polymesh, an institutional-grade blockchain built for security tokens and the first specialized chain of this nature. Security tokens have the ability to alter the financial landscape, unlocking trillions of dollars in asset value and investment, programmably automating operations, and driving new paths to liquidity - but there are significant barriers standing in the way of institutional adoption. The foundations of Polymesh are focused on the most crucial regulatory elements addressed by four key design principles meant to meet the demands of regulators and institutions. Those four principles are Identity, Compliance, Confidentiality, and Governance. When put together, these four pillars can also support complex operations, such as settlement. \r\n\r\nWhen it comes to creating and managing digital securities, Polymesh\u2019s specificity gives it, and the applications built on it, a distinct advantage over those leveraging general-purpose blockchains. The purpose-built infrastructure addresses the gaps in standard blockchain architecture to align the functioning of the blockchain with the requirements of modern capital markets. By combining Polymesh\u2019s deep functionality with user-friendly tools, Polymath stands to transform capital markets.\r\n\r\nAll transactions on the Polymath platform take place using the native POLY token. POLY is the utility token that fuels Polymath Token Studio on Ethereum and is used by issuers creating and managing security tokens on the platform. ",

The market is based on a dual-token ecosystem operating on two blockchain layers, POWR and Sparkz. POWR tokens allow consumers and hosts providing energy to interface with the ecosystem and are protected through Smart Bond technology. POWR tokens can be converted into Sparkz tokens, which can be used for frictionless transactions in the energy exchange market. The initial coin offering for POWR tokens became the largest crowd funding project in Australia and the 14th highest in the world.\r\n\r\nPower Ledger\u2019s team has immense expertise in both blockchain and electricity markets. They\u2019re comprised of six Board of Directors in addition to over ten full time-team members. Power Leger\u2019s five co-founders make up five of the six Board of Director seats of the company. The sixth board seat belongs to venture capitalist Bill Tai. Receiving his MBA from Harvard, Yai is a world-renowned venture capitalist.

After the presale, Power Ledger held an ICO to sell the remaining 160,000,000 POWR tokens allocated to Token Generation Event.  After both rounds, funds raised totaled thirty-four million dollars (AUD). In addition to money raised from its presale and ICO, the Australian Government also awarded Power ledger a grant for 8 million dollars (AUD) to develop its technology and concept further.

It makes use of blockchain's distributed ledger technology to provide a global trading platform for invoice financing. According to the Populous website, \"invoice finance is a form of funding that instantly unlocks the cash tied up in outstanding sales invoices. Business owners allow invoice buyers to buy invoices at a discounted rate in order to unlock their cash quicker. Once invoices are paid by the invoice debtor, the invoice buyer receives the amount previously agreed upon.\"\r\n\r\nIn order to offer funds to invoice sellers, Populous maintains a Liquidity Pool. This is tied in with the Populous cryptocurrency (PPT). An investor securitizes PPT by making an initial purchase. PPT is then held in escrow as collateral throughout the process. Transactions between invoice buyers and sellers take place with Pokens, exchanged for PPT and used as the currency for buying and selling invoices, either drawing from or contributing to the Liquidity Pool in the process. As a result of this built-in liquidity component, Populous at this point requires no transaction fees. In fact, the only fees levied are those associated with late payments. Populous invoice transactions can cover a huge array of industries, including many which are not typically available to traditional financing companies.\r\n\r\nThe PPT tokens not released during the ICO were retained by the founding and development team. PPT can either be held or used as collateral to invest in Populous invoices. In exchange for collateralizing, you\u2019re given an amount of Pokens based on a percentage of market value. Currently it\u2019s the lesser of 50%, or a 30 day market average. These are automatically used to purchase an invoice.

As long Alice has 100 pATOM, she can redeem 100 ATOM (1:1) from the platform back into her Cosmos wallet by burning off her pATOM balance (This is the unwrapping process).\r\n\r\nAfter receiving 100 pATOM, she decides to stake the underlying deposit of 100 ATOM on the Cosmos Hub to earn staking rewards (assume ~7% Annually). On staking, Alice receives 100 stkATOM, and her pATOM balance is now changed to 0 (pATOM burned, stkATOM minted). Let's assume there's an already existing stkATOM-ETH liquidity pool on SushiSwap. Alice supplies all her stkATOM and an equivalent amount of ETH into the Sushi pool to become a liquidity provider (LP). A portion of the trading fees generated on SushiSwap is distributed to all the LPs (Assume that this results in 9% yields annually). Thus, if Alice doesn't face any Impermanent loss at the end of the year, she would earn (7+9)% yield on her 100 ATOM holdings instead of the usual 7% she would have received by simply staking (and not liquid staking). Alice, being a PoS coin staker, leverages pSTAKE's technology to generate additional yield.\"",

Liquid is a global cryptocurrency firm looking to solve the liquidity problems that have surfaced with crypto investments. Liquid brings liquidity to the cryptocurrency space by providing a means for you to easily buy cryptocurrency with and cash-out to fiat. Currently, each crypto exchange has its own level of liquidity that differs between the trading pairs it offers. This creates individual silos that may have great liquidity on one exchange but not on another. The Liquid platform connects these silos into one combined pool to give you the greatest liquidity possible.\r\n\r\nThe Liquid World Book compiles the orders and prices from exchanges around the world into one order book for you to use. This gives any trader, no matter their location, the ability to use the fiat currency of their choice when purchasing or selling crypto. It removes the liquidity silos of separate exchanges and gives more trading power to previously underserved markets. The Prime Brokerage half of the Quoine Liquid platform basically gives you access to the features outlined in the previous World Book section. With Prime Brokerage, you have direct market access to all exchanges in the World Book without having to create an account on each individual exchange. Furthermore, Quoine has been building partnerships with a network of banks over the last several years to ensure the quick transfer of your fiat funds.\r\n\r\nQASH is an ERC20 token you use to pay for services on the Liquid platform. Beyond that, QASH holders may also receive discounts, promotional products, and ICO investment opportunities with coins that Quoine helps to launch. The team also emphasizes in their whitepaper that other organizations may use it for their own purposes similar to how some financial institutions use the Ripple XRP token. Because Quoine enters a few different financial sectors, the company has quite a few competitors. As a credit facility, the company competes with SALT. On the exchange side, there are numerous other businesses like Binance specializing in alternative coins or Gemini and Coinbase focusing on fiat to crypto conversions. \r\n\r\n Mike Kayamori (CEO) and Mario Gomez Lozada (President and CTO) founded Quoine in 2014. Kayamori was previously a Senior Vice President at SoftBank Group and was the Chief Investment Officer of Gungho Asia.

        "description": "QuarkChain is a secure, permission-less, scalable, and decentralized blockchain. One of the goals of QuarkChain is to utilize sharding technology to deliver over 1 million transactions per second (tps). Essentially, QuarkChain markets itself as a peer-to-peer blockchain with a high capacity throughput to help deliver fast and secure decentralized applications. The team behind QuarkChain created this blockchain to resolve the issue of scalability that all the major blockchains are currently facing. The team feels that because of the urgency of this issue, the Bitcoin community simply cannot afford to wait until they all agree on a solution. Instead, they feel that by offering different solutions, such as the one inherent in QuarkChain, this compels the community to split via a hard fork and find the solution that works best.\r\n\r\nQuarkChain encourages increased decentralization through multiple cheap nodes that then create a cluster that works as a super-full node. This prevents the high expenses associated with super-full nodes when the tps gets high. In terms of protection, all transactions within QuarkChain get the protection of 50 percent of the network\u2019s hash power. This makes a double-spending attack incredibly challenging, particularly when combined with QuarkChain\u2019s decentralized nature.\r\n\r\nQuarkChain relies on a two-layer blockchain structure. Sharding blockchains known as shards are the first layer, while the second layer is a root blockchain that confirms the shards\u2019 blocks.The major work on QuarkChain began in Q2 2017 with research into the problem of blockchain scalability. In Q4 of that year, the team drafted the whitepaper. In February 2018, it released the white paper and completed verification code 0.1. March 2018 saw the 0.1 versions of both the wallet and testnet. Now in Q2, the team is working on the testnet 1.0 and smart contract 0.1. In Q4 2018, the team will have the QuarkChain Core 1.0, along with the mainnet 1.0 and the SmartWallet 1.0. By Q2 2019, both the SmartWallet and QuarkChain Core will be in their 2.0 versions.\r\n\r\nQuarkChain is a decentralized blockchain network that aims to resolve the issues of scalability that plague existing networks by using sharding technology. In this way, QuarkChain can dramatically extend the usefulness of blockchain technology since many applications are limited by the scalability of existing blockchain networks. The project is still in progress, but QuarkChain has already made many positive steps and already began invite-based beta testing for the testnet, showing significant progress and potential.\r\n\r\nThe main features of Quarkchain are:\r\n\r\n1. Reshardable two-layered blockchain: Quarkchain consists of two layers of blockchains. We apply elastic sharding blockchains (shards) as the first layer, and a root blockchain as the second layer that confirms the blocks from the first layer. The second layer that confirms the blocks from the first layer. The second layer is flexible to be resharded as needed without changing the root layer.\r\n\r\n2. Guaranteed security by market-driven collaborative mining: To ensure the security of all transactions, a game-theoretic framework is designed for incentives, where at least 50% of overall hash powers are allocated to the root chain to prevent double spending attack on any transactions.\r\n\r\n3. Anti-centralized horizontal scalability: In any blockchain network with a high TPS, a super-full node can be extremely expensive, which encourages centralization. In contrast, QuarkChain allows multiple cheap nodes forming a cluster to replace a super-full node.\r\n\r\n4. Efficient cross-shard transactions: Cross-shard transactions in QuarkChain can be issued at any time, and confirmed in minutes. The speed of cross-shard transactions increases linearly as the number of shards increases.\r\n\r\n5. Simple account management: There is only one account needed for the entire blockchain (shards) in QuarkChain. All cryptocurrencies from different shards are stored in one smart wallet.",

Although starting with Ethereum, the team is building the protocol to be available on any DApp platform in the long run.In an industry where security is a primary concern and bugs have caused the theft of millions of dollars, Quantstamp should help to legitimize blockchain projects and ensure that large-scale smart contract hacks are a thing of the past.\r\n\r\nQuantstamp held a successful ICO in November 2017 in which the team raised a little over $30 million dollars. They distributed 650 million (65%) QSP out of the 1 billion total supply to ICO participants at a price of $0.072 per token. After the usual post-ICO volatility, the QSP price stabilized at around $0.10 (~0.000005 BTC) through the end of November. The price followed the trend of the altcoin market and rose rapidly to an all-time high of $0.82 (~0.000051 BTC) before slowly falling to its current price of ~$0.286. The QSP price weathered the beginning of the year market downfall better than most other altcoins.",

Its goal is to research state channel technology, define protocols and develop reference implementations. The introduction of payment channels, specifically the type first described by the Lightning Whitepaper (which introduced the Lightning Network), seeks to fix the scalability and congestion issues that currently plague blockchain technology. While the Lightning Network operates on the Bitcoin blockchain, Raiden introduces a comparable solution for the Ethereum network.\r\n\r\nThere are several key features of the Raiden Network Token. Expedited transfer confirmations (<1 second ). Current transfers on the Ethereum blockchain can take a few seconds to minutes. Private transfers that are not viewable on the global ledger. Solve scalability issues so that Ethereum can create mass adoption, allowing Ethereum to become the peer-to-peer, global payments infrastructure with electronic cash that it was initially designed for. Low fee transactions. Micropayment capability that works in union with any ERC-20 token.\r\n\r\nThe Raiden Network project is being developed by Germany\u2019s Brainbot Technologies AG, a software company devoted to blockchain protocol development. Founded in the year 2000 by Heiko Hees, it currently has between 11 to 50 employees in offices among Berlin, Mainz, and Copenhagen.

Being a core developer for Ethereum, it is evident on how the founder sees the flaws in the current its present protocol with ways to improve it. Interestingly enough, the website does not include RDN as one of their main blockchain developments, which could be attributed to the difficulty of highlighting a wide variety of projects they are currently undertaking on one page. However, there are no updates on the status of the Raiden Network Project on either Twitter nor Medium since December 1st, 2017.\r\n\r\nRaiden can be used for a wide variety of applications and purposes such as Micropayments For Content Distribution, Decentralized M2M Markets, API Access and Fast Decentralized Exchanges.\"",

Predictive markets have shown to have been effective in accurately forecasting many results however it is still not widely used due to the many regulatory hurdles involved in setting up such a market. Augur aims to set up such a market in a decentralized manner.\r\n\r\nAugur is an Ethereum-based decentralized prediction market that leverages the wisdom of the crowds to create a search engine for the future that runs on its own token, REP. Augur allows users to create their markets for specific questions they may have and to profit from the trading buys while allowing users to buy positive or negative shares regarding the outcome of a future event. Augur REP is the gambling cryptocurrency. It\u2019s the crypto token you can use to bet on sporting events, political  outcomes, economies and just about everything else in the prediction markets. Online gambling is a $52 billion a year industry.\r\n\r\nAt its founding the project included Intrade founder Ron Bernstein, Robin Hanson, and Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin among its advisers. In April 2015, Augur's first contract was uploaded to the Ethereum network.The first beta version was released in March 2016. In October 2016, all the reputation tokens that were for sale during the 2015 crowdfunding campaign were distributed to their owners on the live Ethereum network and the two largest cryptocurrency exchanges, Poloniex and Kraken, added support for these tokens on their trading platforms. The project was delayed until it was launched in July 2018.",

RLC is short for \u201cRun on Lots of Computers.\u201d\r\n\r\niExec is headquartered at Lyon, France. It was founded by Gilles Fedak and Haiwu He, both are serving as Chief Executive Officer and Head of Asian-Pacific Region of iExec, respectively. Oleg Lodygensky is the Chief Technical Officer. Gilles Fedak received his PhD from the University of Paris Sud in 2003, and has been working as INRIA (Inventeurs du Monde Numerique) research scientist at ENS in Lyon, France. Similarly, Haiwu completed his M.Sc. and PhD from the University of Sciences and Technologies of Lille, France. On April 19, 2017, iExec launched its token sale and raised more than $12 million in exchange for 86,999,784 RLC.\r\n\r\nIn order to support dApps, smart contracts, and their platforms, iExec takes processing-intensive computations off-chain so as to keep a blockchain\u2019s on-chain functions running smoothly. To do this, iExec makes use of XtremWeb-HEP, an open-sourced Desktop Grid Software.  Desktop Grid computing (also known as Volunteer Computing) pools unused computing resources to be used by applications and platforms, and according to iExec\u2019s whitepaper, XtremWeb-HEP \u201cimplements all the needed features\u201d to make this possible on a global scale, including \u201cfault-tolerance, multi-applications, multi-users, hybrid public/private infrastructure, deployment of virtual images, data management, security and accountability, and many more.\u201d Essentially, with this software, dApps can utilize any computing resource in the iExec framework to run their programs.\r\n\r\nIn their whitepaper, the iExec team lays out the project\u2019s competitive landscape and explains these competitors in relation to iExec. They\u2019re quick to note that decentralized cloud storage providers like Filecoin, Storj, and Siacoin are not direct competitors, and it\u2019s easy to see why.  While iExec could theoretically take a step in this direction as it matures, it\u2019s not a storage platform; it\u2019s a computing platform. This does put it in competition with other decentralized computing protocols like Golem and SONM. Both of these, however, are taking aim at a different animal.  Essentially, they\u2019re both building a decentralized supercomputer on blockchain technology, while iExec is targeting dApp development and sustainability.  Both look towards a future of a blockchain-powered, decentralized internet, but their functions, while sometimes similar, are more complementary than conflicting.",

It is an Ethereum ERC20 token that is pegged to $1 USD\u200a\u2014\u200aevery Dai is worth $1, and will always be worth $1, regardless of how much Dai is in existence. There is no centralized authority like Tether that backs its value, and no traditional bank that backs each Dai with a real US dollar. There is nothing that can be shut down, and no centralized authority that needs to be trusted. Dai lives entirely within the Ethereum blockchain using smart contracts.\r\n\r\n*Features of Dai:\r\n1. Dai is always worth $1 USD each\r\n2. It can be freely traded like any other ERC20 token\r\n3. Anyone with an Ethereum wallet can own, accept, and transfer it\r\n4. It can be exchanged without any middleman\r\n5. No individual person or company has control over it\r\n6. No government or authority can shut it down\r\n\r\n*How Dai Works?\r\nDai is a masterpiece of game theory that carefully balances economic incentives in the pursuit of one goal\u200a\u2014\u200aa token that is continuously approaching the value of $1 USD.\r\n\r\nWhen Dai is worth above $1, mechanisms work to decrease the price. When Dai is worth below $1, mechanisms work to increase the price. The rational actors that take part in these mechanisms do so because they earn money anytime Dai is not perfectly worth $1. This is why Dai is always floating slightly above or below $1\u200a\u2014\u200ait is an endless wave function bouncing infinitely close to $1, but never quite achieving it. The farther Dai goes from $1, the more incentive there is to fix it. This is the magic of Dai.\r\n\r\n*How is Dai Created?\r\nDai is simply a loan against Ethereum. By using the MakerDAO dApp, advanced users can take loans out in Dai against their ETH holdings.\r\n\r\nFirst, ETH is turned into \u201cwrapped ETH\u201d (WETH), which is simply an ERC20 wrapping around ETH. This \u201ctokenizes\u201d ETH so it can be used like any other ERC20 token. Next, WETH is turned into \u201cpooled ETH\u201d (PETH), which means it joins a large pool of Ethereum that is the collateral for all Dai created. Once you have PETH, you can create a \u201ccollateralized debt position\u201d (CDP), which locks up your PETH and allows you to draw Dai against your collateral, which is PETH. As you draw out Dai, the ratio of debt in the CDP increases. There is a debt limit that sets a maximum amount of Dai you can draw against your CDP. Once you have Dai, you can spend or trade it freely like any other ERC20 token.\r\n\r\n*There are several important reasons why you would create Dai, despite the hassle:\r\n\r\n1. You need a loan, and have an asset (ETH) to use as collateral for your loan\r\n\r\n2. You believe ETH is going up in value. You can use your CDP to buy ETH on margin\u200a\u2014\u200ayou lock up your ETH in a CDP, draw Dai against it, use the Dai to buy more ETH on an exchange, and then use that ETH to further increase the size of your CDP. This can be accomplished without any third-party or centralized authority allowing you to do so\u200a\u2014\u200amargin trading can be accomplished entirely on the blockchain.\r\n\r\n3. The demand for Dai has driven the price above $1 USD. When this occurs, you can create Dai then immediately sell it on an exchange for greater than $1 USD. This is essentially free money, and is one of the mechanisms the Maker system uses to keep Dai pegged to $1 USD. Dai being worth over $1 USD encourages more Dai to be created.\r\nThese three reasons are enough to ensure that Dai is continually created.",

        "description": "SIREN is a distributed protocol for creating, trading, and redeeming fully-collateralized options contracts for any ERC-20 token on Ethereum.\r\n\r\nAbout SIREN\r\nOptions are a financial primitive from which one can build many different more complex financial instruments. At their core, options give a trader the choice to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price at a known time in the future. This is useful for protecting one's self (also known as hedging) against possible price changes in the asset, as well as speculating on these price changes.\r\n\r\nCore Protocol Mechanics\r\nSIREN uses a fully-collateralized approach to writing options that doesn\u2019t require any oracles to function. A single MarketsRegistry contract creates and coordinates individual markets. Once a Market contract is created anyone can interact with it in a permissionless manner. The solvency of a position is ensured at all times by the collateral locked in the smart contract.\r\n\r\nWith SIREN, both the long and short side of the contract are tokenized. The buyer\u2019s side (bToken) gives the holder the right to purchase or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined strike priceThe seller\u2019s/writer\u2019s side (wToken) allows the holder to withdraw the collateral (if the option was not exercised) or withdraw the exercise payment (if the option was exercised) from the contract after expiration.\r\n\r\nWhen a trader buys a put the on-chain token amount is multiplied by the strike. For example, a 1 WBTC $20K PUT will result in 20,000 bTokens. For the same reason, a put is just a reversed-assets call (e.g. a WBTC/USDC put is actually a USDC/WBTC call).\u200b\r\n\r\nTokenizing both sides of the contract allows SIREN to create secondary markets for both the long and short exposure. Under such a design in order to become a writer one purchases a wToken from the SirenSwap AMM (see below). A writer can also unwind their short exposure by selling the wToken back to the AMM. This streamlines the write-side mechanics by reducing it to essentially purchasing the underlying collateral at discount\u200a\u2014\u200aas opposed to a typical design where the writer mints long tokens and has to then sell them in order to realize the premium.\r\n\r\nSirenSwap AMM\r\nBootstrapping liquidity is core to creating a thriving market. Options are notoriously difficult when it comes to that. Not only does liquidity get fractured by combination of strike prices and expirations, it also requires sophistication on the part of liquidity providers in order to ensure fair and sustainable pricing.\r\n\r\nTo ensure liquidity on day 1 the SIREN protocol utilizes a custom SirenSwap AMM that uses a novel combination of a constant-product bonding curve and options minting to trade both bTokens and wTokens. Notably, the AMM doesn\u2019t require any asset in the pool other than bTokens/wTokens in order to trade them against the collateral asset (e.g. WBTC). This increases LP capital efficiency and provides other benefits that we\u2019ll expand on in further posts.\r\n\r\nThe SIREN core team believes that in these early days of Ethereum and DeFi less is more, so they designed SirenSwap to be a model-less market maker. This means there is no complex on-chain pricing formula nor oracle feed required in order for it to function. This makes it easy for anyone to become an LP to potentially earn trading fees.",

Using the Solve.Care platform, businesses are able to launch networked, interoperable healthcare dApps, within only weeks or even days.  \r\n\r\nCare Networks on the Solve.Care platform use the SOLVE token, a utility token that is used for inter/intra network payments and transaction fees. It also has additional uses including developer rights, staking, marketplace payments, and platform access fees. \r\n\r\nWho is the Founder of Solve.Care?\r\n\r\nPradeep Goel, the Founder and CEO of Solve.Care, has extensive expertise in healthcare, finance and technology. Prior to Solve.Care, he had been in the CEO, COO, CIO and CTO roles at various innovative technology companies over 25 years\r\n\r\nPradeep was deeply involved in designing and building solutions for public programs such as Medicare/Medicaid, children health insurance and welfare programs, SNAP/TANF, health insurance exchanges and health information exchanges. He has worked for and with commercial insurance companies as the top technology executive, and implemented benefits administration, consumer engagement, claimed medication and payment systems. \r\n\r\nPradeep has built 4 healthcare IT companies and has been at the top of Deloitte\u2019s Technology Fast 500, INC500/5000 fastest growing companies lists multiple times. Pradeep was included in the 100 most promising entrepreneurs globally, complied by Goldman Sachs.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Makes Solve.Care Unique?\r\n\r\nThe Solve.Care platform leverages blockchain and full stack capabilities to deliver significant business value to individuals and enterprises. These business values include ease of usage, privacy, security, control and ownership of data, interoperability, auditability, and enhanced trust between parties.\r\n\r\nSolve.Care gives healthcare stakeholders a unique opportunity to build their own dApps to form Care Networks, connecting and synchronizing their participants, making instant payments inside their network, and sharing information immediately to reduce opportunities for fraud. \r\n\r\nSolve.Care is unique because it not only allows networks to run independently, but to also have a fabric underneath that allows them to all communicate.\r\n\r\nAll Care Networks are fully and intrinsically tokenized to manage events, identities, transactions, payments and data sharing using the SOLVE token, which is a combination of transaction fee payment token (like Ethereum as gas), as well as a normal payment currency. The SOLVE token also has a unique property of being able to function inside the Network, either as a variable value token or as a fixed value token (as a stable coin). This property makes it uniquely powerful and appropriate for healthcare usage. \r\n\r\n\r\nSolve.Care has built blockchain healthcare networks for the real-world clients such as Boehringer Ingelheim, Uber Health, Lyft, Aon, Arizona Care Network and others. \r\n\r\nSolve.Care is the first company in the world to successfully deploy digital currency and blockchain technology for value-based payments in US healthcare.

The project aims to fast track mainstream adoption of blockchain and cryptocurrency through an ecosystem of practical products and services.\r\n\r\nSparkPoint started with an initial funding of $50,000. With only this minimal capital combined with discipline, determination, and hard work, the team was able to launch various blockchain-based products and services including SparkPoint Wallet, SparkLearn, SparkPlay, SparkEarn, and SparkDeFi. These products and services have collectively reached hundreds of thousands of users and are steadily growing.\r\n\r\nThe SparkPoint Ecosystem is composed of:\r\n\r\nSparkPoint Wallet\r\n\r\nNon-custodial mobile cryptocurrency wallet that natively supports various cryptocurrencies including SparkPoint (SRK), Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), and other ERC-20 tokens.

A series of token burns have reduced the total supply down to 14,368,540,937 SRK tokens. Quarterly token burns are scheduled in the future to reduce the total supply to its final fixed maximum value of 10 billion SRK tokens. There are currently 6,486,932,911 SRK tokens in circulation.\r\n\r\nOf the initial total supply, 20% of the tokens were distributed to private sale participants. A minimal amount was allocated for sale to avoid any sudden fall in the price of SRK in the market. 7% of the tokens were allocated for marketing and airdrops, and 10% for community development programs. Majority of the tokens were allocated for SparkPoint Ecosystem Development at 38%. Most of the tokens that were burned were also part of this allocation.

Instead of maintaining its own data centres, Storj platform relies on a peer-to-peer network of individuals or entities sharing their storage spaces. The Storj project is owned and developed by Storj Labs Inc. Storj intends to facilitate a faster, cheaper, and secure file storage solution than traditional cloud storage platforms. To achieve its goal, Storj deploys several innovative technologies and methods to make sure that users are able to store and retrieve data in a fastest possible way while not compromising the security and integrity of data.\r\n\r\nStorj Labs Inc was founded in 2014 by Shawn Wilkinson with co-founders John Quinn. The company is headquartered at Atlanta, Georgia in the United States. Shawn was previously appointed as CEO, but in March 2018, he stepped down from the post to serve as CSO of the company.\r\n\r\nShawn was replaced by Ben Golub (Ex-CEO of Docker) who currently serves as the Executive Chairman & Interim CEO. Co-founder John Quinn has been appointed as the Chief Revenue Officer. The company launched its initial coin offering (ICO) of the new tokens on May 19, 2017. At the end of the token sale on May 25, 2017, the company had raised about $30 million. Storj Labs allowed SJCX holders to exchange their tokens with the new ones in a 1:1 ratio through a token conversion campaign which lasted till October 2017.\r\n\r\nStorj Labs pre-mined its entire supply of tokens at the inception; no new tokens can be created via STORJ mining. Nevertheless, users can obtain STORJ tokens by becoming a farmer in the network. Another obvious way to acquire STORJ is through trading on a cryptocurrency exchange. Up until now, cloud storage companies have dictated the terms of service to their users, and as a result, there has been little to no competition within this digital sector. However, with the introduction of Storj, all of that may change.\"\r\n\r\nCheck out CoinBureau for the full review on OmiseGo.",

One of the unique things about Swarm City is that the data is stored locally on your device. There\u2019s no central database. It\u2019s also an open source project. Swarm City was created by a development team from Antwerp and entrepreneurs from the United States. The project was initially launched as a decentralized world known as Arcade City. The whitepaper for Arcade City for appeared online in October 2016.\r\n\r\nSwarm City allows people to communicate and transact in a decentralized way. Like other blockchain platforms, Swarm City has no middleman or trusted, centralized platform. It\u2019s a P2P environment based on the Ethereum blockchain. One of the key features of Swarm City is the use of the Swarm City Token, or SWT. It\u2019s the unique of exchange in Swarm City. All transactions on Swarm City are sent using SWT. Like other decentralized platforms built on Ethereum, Swarm City needs to use its own token to power he blockchain. Once you have SWT, you can use tokens for every exchange. Users can choose to see a transaction in dollars, Euros, or SWT. However, SWT is always the actual vehicle for the transaction. All transactions are recorded onto the public ledger using SWT.\r\n\r\nSwarm City has several features such as offers. Any user can publish a request for services or goods as an offer. Whether it\u2019s ride-sharing or medical services, your offer can be posted to the Swarm City network. Besides, with Swarm City, funds are deposited into an escrow until the user releases the funds to the receiver. For every offer created, Swarm City automatically makes a smart contract. Both users deposit tokens into the smart contract as a guarantee for a successful transaction. In the event of a dispute, the user will not release the funds, and can start the process of resolving the dispute. There are also \u201cguilds\u201d that can resolve disputes based on their \u201cCharter of the Guild\u201d. Swarm City has a reputation system that works without the need to collect personal data.

The SYNC Network addresses these problems and offers a workable solution through tradeable stakes bonding Uniswap liquidity pairs with a fully trustless ERC-20 token (SYNC).\r\n\r\nSYNC enables users to earn interest by staking a cyptographic bond to Uniswap liquidity pair tokens (Crypto Bonds).\r\n\r\nCrypto Bonds are an NFT (ERC-721) token with collectible attributes, accruing interest rates, and the ability to separately trade and speculate on them within a secondary market.\r\n\r\nSYNC Network works to bring stability and risk mitigation to decentralized finance by solidifying a guarantee on holding liquidity pairs for an extended period of time. The Sync Network can help build a needed, stable foundation for the DeFi space and a fully functioning, more robust trustless economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n--\r\nThe SYNC Network is composed of two main contracts: the SYNC ERC-20 contract and the Crypto Bond ERC-721 contract. SYNC tokens have an undefined total supply with inflationary and deflationary attributes through the interactions with Crypto Bond investors.\r\n\r\nDespite being a long-term investment, Crypto Bonds do not share anything in common with traditional finance bonds. The name comes from the bonding of liquidity pairs and our own token. Crypto Bonds introduce proof of long-term position in DeFi liquidity pools, and will naturally strengthen the core of DeFi finance as a whole. They are a tradeable, long-term (90 days - 3 years) stake - bonding Uniswap liquidity-pair tokens together with SYNC.\r\n\r\nDeflation of the currency happens when Crypto Bonds are created, burning SYNC from the total supply. Using a Crypto Bond, an investor is able to lock liquidity-pair tokens with the corresponding dollar-to-dollar value in SYNC at some guaranteed interest rate of SYNC upon maturation. Dividend paying versions are also available. Therefore, this occurs in inflation, minting the principle plus interest.\r\n\r\nCrypto Bond Interest Rates\r\nSYNC balances itself through daily, self-correcting interest rates.\r\nInterest rates of bonds depends on three factors.\r\n1. Total supply of sync in the market.\r\n2. Duration of bond\r\n3.

It's tokenomics include 0% buy tax forever and 4% of every sell is burned. The supply is all circulating and constantly getting lower. It is mathematically designed to get to $1 ten times quicker than DOGE and to grow even faster than SHIB. \r\n\r\nThere are constant holder giveaways in the BIG $SHAK LOTTO whereby a random holder is selected to win a prize at price milestones. The higher the price of the token gets the bigger the prize gets. When the price is $1 there will be a $1,000,000 giveaway.\r\n\r\nThere is a 2D game on the way that shows SHAK jumping other its rivals DOGE and SHIB in an endless runner style game. Top scorers will also win tokens.\r\n\r\nThe project intends to expand the token utility and have NFT farming amongst many other features as the community grows. ",

In doing so, it challenges the current monopoly held by industry heavyweights Steam, Google, and Apple. This will unlock new opportunities and create value for all the actors involved. Large commercial partnerships are signed, the protocol and platform have been built and will be launched in open beta in October 2019.\r\n\r\nUOS is the Token that powers the Ultra Ecosystem and can be used to purchase everything on the platform, including games, virtual items and ads for game developers. Ultra will accept traditional forms of payment such as Paypal and credit cards as well. These fiat currency transactions are converted to UOS seamlessly on the backend and are completed on the blockchain with UOS tokens. The token will also be used across the platform in many non-transactional ways including betting, tournaments, and donations.\r\n\r\nTIMELOCK: 10 to 20% of every transaction will be kept in a smart contract for 60 days. In addition, 5% of Ultra profits will be reserved for 2 years to fund exclusive games that use its blockchain and NFTs capabilities.\r\nENGAGEMENT: Tokens are earned by performing specific actions such as; helping developers to build better games; watching ads; beta testing; answering surveys, and more.\r\nSTACKING: Players can get rewarded with free games, swag and exclusive content just by holding tokens.\r\nSPENDABILITY: Users can buy and sell games/items for UOS, and in hundreds of shops through partners.",

You pay an entry fee in $WAM tokens to enter a tournament and if you find yourself among the top performing players of that tournament, you win more coins.\r\n\r\nThe concept of making money by playing hyper-casual games based on skill is new in the gaming industry and WAM.app is the first platform in the world that let you do this. All you need in order to play on the WAM.app platform is a few minutes of your time and the desire to be the best. You can participate in tournaments all around the world, wherever you have internet access. Players don\u2019t have to be connected at the same time, and that is very good for players because each can compete whenever they find the time to do so.\r\n\r\nThe WAM ecosystem will offer multiple roles that users can voluntarily take up and be incentivised to be the best with token gains.\r\n\r\n1. Player \u2014 play 2 earn;\r\nIf you play any WAM game, you can begin making money based on how competitive you are.\r\n\r\n2. Owner \u2014 own 2 earn;\r\nIf you own a WAM game as an NFT, you will win a percentage of all of the WAM coins that accumulate as entry fees in every tournament. You can buy a game and if the brand value of the game goes up, you can sell it for profit on the WAM Marketplace.\r\n\r\n3. Marketer \u2014 Market 2 earn;\r\nYou can rent a game from an owner and organize tournaments for that game. You will get your own percentage of all of the WAM coins the tournament accumulates through entry fees. Renting will be very easy and percentage based. The Owner will split with you a percentage of the revenue you bring him with the tournaments you organize and market.\r\n\r\n4. Developer \u2014 Develop 2 earn;\r\nYou can develop games and sell them on the WAM Marketplace. Every time your game is sold, you will receive a lifetime commission from the sale. You can also choose a percentage of the WAM Coins accumulated by tournaments to be distributed to you, regardless of who currently owns the game.\r\n\r\nThese roles will be the backbone of the WAM ecosystem economy. WAM will benefit from everything happening in the ecosystem. ",

        "description": "What is Navcoin (NAV)?\r\n\r\nNavcoin, launched in 2014, is an open-sourced digital currency offering fast and reliable payments with innovative technological and privacy features. Storing coins on a Navcoin wallet allows for making public or private transactions, earning rewards through staking (for network validation) or mixing coins (for privacy enhancement), and having a vote in project proposals.\r\n\u2028Unique to Navcoin\u2019s cryptosystem is that public NAV coins can be converted 1:1 to xNAV, the revolutionary privacy coin that guarantees untraceable transactions. Additionally, Navcoin has launched wNAV, a wrapped representation of NAV, that can be used in ecosystems such as Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain (BSC).\u2028\u2028Navcoin was launched without pre-mining or an ICO to achieve a fair and transparent initial distribution of the supply. The project operates as a fully Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), without a central decision making authority (unlike most other projects). Anyone can participate by simply staking NAV in their wallet, thereby obtaining a say in protocol governance and a vote on proposals that arise from within the community.\u2028\u2028How are Navcoin\u2019s privacy-enhanced features achieved?\r\n\u2028Navcoin\u2019s philosophy is to provide people with privacy preserving solutions that allow them to express themselves financially and transact as they desire. This has resulted in the development of xNAV, a privacy coin based on the decentralized, trustless, and permissionless technologies of the future.\u2028\u2028First of all, xNAV is built on top of the self-developed privacy protocol blsCT that merges Boneh-Lynn-Shacham (BLS) Signatures and Confidential Transactions (CT). BLS compresses a group of signatures into a single compact signature that authenticates the entire group, thereby shielding the origin of individual transactions. CT is a well-established privacy protocol that obfuscates the amount of coins in a transaction.\u2028\u2028On top of that, xNAV ensures personal privacy by using Stealth Addresses, public-key cryptography and the innovative Dandelion++ protocol. Stealth Addresses are private addresses which ensure complete privacy for the receiver of a transaction. Dandelion++ is a communication mixing protocol which breaks the link between a message and its source. \r\n\r\nWhen using blsCT, two xNAV transactions can be merged into one, and transactions can be aggregated an infinite number of times. This allows Navcoin to scale effectively and support a high quantity of transactions across the network and users\u2019 transactions are completely shielded and untraceable. Anyone trying to monitor transactions being made through Navcoin\u2019s network is unable to tell if a transaction has been aggregated or not, and users are able to merge their coins with other individuals making transactions. When doing so, a user\u2019s wallet uses Dandelion++ to send an anonymous request for coins from other nodes. These nodes can then connect and communicate between them using public-key cryptography to broadcast the session and their coins to mix. From those, the sender can randomly select several coins from the responses received. These coins are in turn mixed together with the original user\u2019s coins, and then sent to the network, and this system ensures true privacy while also enabling anyone who helps to facilitate the mixing-process by providing liquidity to receive a fee for their service, and generate a passive income.\u2028\u2028Combining these technologies, xNAV stands out in scalability and privacy, effectively supporting high quantities of transactions across the network with shielded and untraceable transactions.\u2028\u2028How is Navcoin\u2019s network secured?\r\n\u2028Navcoin\u2019s network is secured by a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, which means that anyone can use their NAV to help validate transaction blocks. By comparison, Bitcoin\u2019s Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism requires miners to calculate huge mathematical problems to process transactions and earn rewards. This requires expensive hardware and is extremely energy intensive. Navcoin\u2019s PoS consensus mechanism does away with these resource intensive requirements; even a 5 Volt Raspberry Pi can take part in securing the network.\u2028\r\nNavcoin\u2019s users can earn passive income in two distinct ways. First of all, users can help secure the network by staking NAV to validate transactions. With block times of 30 seconds, the block reward is 2.5 NAV. Of each reward, 2 NAV are for the staker, and 0.5 NAV are held in a decentralized treasury, the Community Fund, used for self-funded community initiatives. \u2028\u2028Users can also mutually merge their xNAV coins over various nodes to facilitate the mixing process that ensures xNAV\u2019s privacy and anonymity. Users are rewarded a fair compensation fee in return for this service.\r\n\r\nHow is Navcoin\u2019s network governed?\r\n\r\nIn addition to helping to secure the network, Navcoin\u2019s PoS consensus mechanism enables all public NAV holders to get involved with governing their platform. There is no central authority controlling Navcoin, and community members play a crucial role in maintaining a fair and decentralized system of decision making. As a result, Navcoin operates as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) with all protocol administration and consensus changes being subject to an open voting system. All community members holding their NAV on the public side can participate in the DAO by staking their coins, and each stake is the equivalent of one vote. This gives each wallet holder a say in protocol governance, and allows them to vote on any proposals that arise. To ensure widespread participation, there is also no minimum staking amount required for anyone to take part in voting. \r\n\r\nNavcoin\u2019s governance system also incorporates a Community Fund to ensure that contributors and projects can be compensated and funded by the network.\r\n",

Stellar aims to help facilitate cross-asset transfer of value at a fraction of a penny while aiming to be an open financial system that gives people of all income levels access to low-cost financial services. Stellar can handle exchanges between fiat-based currencies and between cryptocurrencies. Stellar.org, the organization that supports Stellar, is centralized like XRP and meant to handle cross platform transactions and micro transactions like XRP. However, unlike Ripple, Stellar.org is non-profit and their platform itself is open source and decentralized. \r\n\r\nStellar was founded by Jed McCaleb in 2014. Jed McCaleb is also the founder of Mt. Gox and co-founder of Ripple, launched the network system Stellar with former lawyer Joyce Kim. Stellar is also a payment technology that aims to connect financial institutions and drastically reduce the cost and time required for cross-border transfers. In fact, both payment networks used the same protocol initially.\r\n\r\nDistributed Exchange\r\nThrough the use of its intermediary currency Lumens (XLM), a user can send any currency that they own to anyone else in a different currency.\r\n\r\nFor instance, if Joe wanted to send USD to Mary using her EUR, an offer is submitted to the distributed exchange selling USD for EUR. This submitted offer forms is known as an order book. The network will use the order book to find the best exchange rate for the transaction in-order to minimize the fee paid by a user.\r\n\r\nThis multi-currency transaction is possible because of \"Anchors\". Anchors are trusted entities that hold people\u2019s deposits and can issue credit. In essence, Anchors serves as the bridge between different currencies and the Stellar network.\r\n\r\nLumens (XLM)\r\nLumens are the native asset (digital currency) that exist on the Stellar network that helps to facilitate multi-currency transactions and prevent spams. For multi-currency transactions, XLM is the digital intermediary that allows for such a transaction to occur at a low cost.\r\n\r\nIn-order to prevent DoS attacks (aka spams) that would inevitably occur on the Stellar network, a small fee of 0.00001 XLM is associated with every transaction that occurs on the network. This fee is small enough so it does not significantly affect the cost of transaction, but large enough so it dissuades bad actors from spamming the network. \r\n\r\nPrior to Protocol 12, Stellar had a built-in inflation mechanism conceived to allow account holders to collectively direct inflation-generated lumens toward projects built on Stellar.\r\n\r\nAs the network evolved and grew, it became increasingly clear that inflation wasn\u2019t working as intended \u2014 account holders either didn\u2019t set their inflation destination or joined inflation pools to claim the inflation themselves, and the operational costs associated with inflation payments continued to rise \u2014 and so a protocol change to disable inflation was proposed, implemented, voted on by validators, and ultimately adopted as part of a network upgrade.\r\n\r\nThe inflation operation is now deprecated.\r\nhttps://developers.stellar.org/docs/glossary/inflation/\r\n",

        "description": "Ripple is the catchall name for the cryptocurrency platform, the transactional protocol for which is actually XRP, in the same fashion as Ethereum is the name for the platform that facilitates trades in Ether. Like other cryptocurrencies, Ripple is built atop the idea of a distributed ledger network which requires various parties to participate in validating transactions, rather than any singular centralized authority. That facilitates transactions all over the world, and transfer fees are far cheaper than the likes of bitcoin. Unlike other cryptocurrencies, XRP transfers are effectively immediate, requiring no typical confirmation time.\r\n\r\nRipple was originally founded by a single company, Ripple Labs, and continues to be backed by it, rather than the larger network of developers that continue bitcoin\u2019s development. It also doesn\u2019t have a fluctuating amount of its currency in existence. Where bitcoin has a continually growing pool with an eventual maximum, and Ethereum theoretically has no limit, Ripple was created with all of its 100 billion XRP tokens right out of the gate. That number is maintained with no mining and most of the tokens are owned and held by Ripple Labs itself \u2014 around 60 billion at the latest count.\r\n\r\nEven at the recently reduced value of around half a dollar per XRP, that means Ripple Labs is currently sitting on around $20 billion worth of the cryptocurrency (note: Ripple\u2019s price crashed hard recently, and may be worth far less than $60 billion by time you read this). It holds 55 billion XRP in an escrow account, which allows it to sell up to a billion per month if it so chooses in order to fund new projects and acquisitions. Selling such an amount would likely have a drastic effect on the cryptocurrency\u2019s value, and isn\u2019t something Ripple Labs plans to do anytime soon.\r\n\r\nIn actuality, Ripple Labs is looking to leverage the technology behind XRP to allow for faster banking transactions around the world. While Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are built on the idea of separating financial transactions from the financial organizations of traditional currencies, Ripple is almost the opposite in every sense.\r\n\r\nXRP by Ripple price can be found on this page alongside the market capitalization and additional stats.\r\n\r\n",

It is a coin that promotes themselves on major ideas of self-amendment and on-chain governance. It is an Ethereum-like blockchain that hosts smart contracts. It allows the community to vote and improve its flaws. Any token holder may delegate their voting rights to others in the network. The coin uses a generic network shell which allow different transaction and consensus protocols that a blockchain needs to be compatible.\r\n\r\nThe source code is implemented on OCaml which is a fast, flexible and functional programming language which should suit an ambitious project and its technical requirements. Tezos\u2019 proof-of-stake consensus algorithm is different from the delegated proof-of-stake (dPOS) where they go by the name liquid proof-of-stake. This liquid proof-of-stake that Tezos uses focus in filling the gap between both security and decentralization but still being able to take advantage of the benefits that delegated proof-of-stake offers. The staking process in Tezos is called \u201cbaking\u201d. In this blockchain, bakers who make deposits will be rewarded for signing up and publishing blocks. However, if a baker commits any bad behavior the deposits will be forfeited.\r\n\r\nBaking & Endorsing\r\nBaking is what Tezos refers to as the action of signing and publishing a new block in the chain. Bakers need at least 8,000 XTZ to qualify as a delegate, and having additional delegated stake increases their chances of being selected as a Baker or Endorser.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of each cycle (4096 blocks), the Bakers for each block are randomly selected and published. Bakers earn a block reward of 40 XTZ for baking a block.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the Baker, 32 Endorsers are randomly selected to verify the last block that was baked. Endorsers receive 1.25 XTZ for each block they endorse.\r\n\r\nBlock Rewards & Inflation\r\nBlock rewards are funded by protocol defined inflation. Rewards are calibrated so that the number of XTZ tokens grows at roughly 5.5% per year. If 100% of Tezos tokens are delegated, the annualized yield will be 5.5%. As of May 2021, approximately 78.8% of Tezos tokens have been delegated, including the 10% owned by the Tezos Foundation, so the annualized yield is roughly 5.8%.\r\n\r\nTo ensure Bakers and Endorsers act honestly, they are required to post a security deposit for each block they Bake or Endorse. They forfeit this deposit in the event of malicious activity, such as double baking or double endorsing a block.\r\n\r\nIn 2018, Tezos successfully launched their main network after delaying the launch due to corporate governance disputes. The Tezos foundation planned to transition the network to a mainnet, or a more complete version. The foundation has also raised $232 million in July 2017 to build the network and issue a new type of cryptocurrency to its backers in one of the largest- ever initial coin offerings. The founders have also made it clear in their blog that the network is using a new blockchain technology hence unexpected issues may still occur affecting the network.\r\n\r\nCheck out CoinBureau for the complete review of Tezos.",

Most investors have experienced this first-hand: You find a digital asset you like and want to invest in. However, the coin is only available on a handful of exchanges. On top of that, you can only use Bitcoin or Ethereum to trade for it. This leads to a sometimes hour-long process filled with multiple manual transfers over at least two exchanges.\r\n\r\nPayment channels provide an instant way to transfer digital assets off-chain between two parties. The transactions are only recorded on the blockchain when the payment channel is first opened and when it\u2019s closed. You can think of it as updating balances on both ends of the channel for each transfer. Once you close the payment channel, both parties get their respective final balances. Payment channels are trustless \u2013 any disputes are resolved automatically through cryptography. And, transfers using them are secured by the underlying blockchain making them as reliable as exchanges on the blockchain itself. Bitcoin\u2019s Lightning Network and Ethereum\u2019s Raiden Network are two of the most popular examples of payment channels.\r\n\r\nJames Wo (CEO), Terry Culver (CSO), Mikael Wang (Chief Blockchain Architect), and Kilian Rausch (Product Director) lead the Exchange Union management team.

Zcash payments are published on a public blockchain, but the sender, recipient, and amount of a transaction remain private.\r\n\r\nZcash is based on peer-reviewed cryptographic research, and built by a security-specialized engineering team on an open source platform based on Bitcoin Core's battle-tested codebase. Our improvement over Bitcoin is the addition of privacy. Zcash uses advanced cryptographic techniques, namely zero-knowledge proofs, to guarantee the validity of transactions without revealing additional information about them.\r\n\r\nHow Zcash works\r\n\r\nZcash encrypts the contents of shielded transactions. Since the payment information is encrypted, the protocol uses a novel cryptographic method to verify their validity.\r\n\r\nZcash uses a zero-knowledge proof construction called a zk-SNARK, developed by our team of experienced cryptographers based on recent breakthroughs in cryptography. These constructions allow the network to maintain a secure ledger of balances without disclosing the parties or amounts involved. Instead of publicly demonstrating spend-authority and transaction values, the transaction metadata is encrypted and zk-SNARKs are used to prove that nobody is cheating or stealing.\r\n\r\nZcash also enables users to send public payments which work similarly to Bitcoin. With the support for both shielded and transparent addresses, users can choose to send Zcash privately or publicly. Zcash payments sent from a shielded address to a transparent address reveal the received balance, while payments from a transparent address to a shielded address protect the receiving value. \r\n\r\nCheck out CoinBureau for guide on What is ZCash.",

The white paper mentions that the transactions speed would be approximately a thousand times more than that of Ethereum network. Ziliqa is fast, secured and decentralized. Zilliqa\u2019s high throughput means that you can focus on developing your ideas without worrying about network congestion, high transaction fees or security which are the key issues with legacy blockchain platforms. Zilliqa network uses a concept called Sharding where the transactions are grouped into smaller groups and divided among the miners for the parallel transactional verification. Developing smaller groups for transactional verification means the Consensus can be reached faster and hence a higher number of transactions can be processed in a given time frame. The capacity of the network linearly increases in other cryptocurrencies as the number of people joins the network, but in this case, the capacity is increased at a higher variable rate than the number of members joining the network. By incorporating the Sharding Technology, it can completely revolutionize the smart contract functionality too. Ziliqa has few pros as it has a great new technology. Zilliqa is the first platform to use sharding technology. This puts it ahead of the rest of the market. It\u2019s a completely new kind of blockchain designed to solve the problem of scalability. Third-generation platforms like Zilliqa could be the big winners in the future of cryptocurrency. Ziliqa has a strong community. The platform has a lot of fans.

Quadrant aims to provide a blueprint for mapping disparate data sources.

Data Consumers can trust the authenticity of the data they purchase, \u201cNurseries\u201d (Data Producers) are compensated fairly every time their data is used, and \u201cPioneers\u201d (Data Vendors) have the incentive to create innovative Constellations. This new transparent ecosystem ensures that companies get the authentic data they need.\r\n\r\nWhere Quadrant has major potential for impact is the ability it provides \u201cElons\u201d (the brightest data minds) to find linkages between different constellations and, in turn, create mega Constellations that can be used by Data Consumers to solve real-world problems. This is where Quadrant differentiates itself from its competitors.\r\n\r\nQuadrant is designed to work with both centralised and decentralised services. The architecture consists of the core Quadrant blockchain, clients (Data Producer, Data Consumer and Anchor), and Guardian Nodes. Quadrant will operate on a Proof of Authority consensus mechanism so that it can handle more transactions, operate at a lower gas price, achieve faster transactions, and restrict malicious nodes from entering data into the network. An external Proof of Work chain will be used as an anchor for security purposes. For the time being, the Ethereum blockchain will be used for anchoring but it can be replaced by any public chain in the future if needed.\r\n\r\nQuadrant will utilise two different currencies for its network: eQuad and QUAD. QUAD, a utility token, is designed to be used solely on the network. It will be used to stamp data, support simple and complex access structures, simple and complex subscription payments, and for staking by Elons. eQuad is an ERC-20-compliant token that will be sold during the Token Generation Event (TGE). It may be converted into QUAD via a gateway when the Quadrant mainnet is launched.\r\n\r\n",

All EOS token holders holding over 100 tokens* at the end of Day 300 of the EOS crowdsale (April 15th 2018, 01:00:00 UTC) will receive 1 eosDAC token for each EOS token that they hold, these tokens will be transferred directly into their Ethereum (ERC20 compatible) wallet.

If your exchange is not prepared to do this you would need to withdraw your EOS tokens to an exchange that does support the eosDAC airdrop, or better still to an ethereum address for which you have the private key.

It comes with default decentralized applications and tools out of the box, not only to be used by everyone but also to be hosted by anyone. These applications are supplied as interpretation engines, which prevents blockchain bloat.
